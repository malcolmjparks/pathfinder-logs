    <h1 id="cult-of-cinders">Cult of Cinders</h1>
<h2 id="children-of-the-godslayers">Children of the Godslayers</h2>
<p>Going through the portal, they find a passageway that looks like it was made of hardened lava. A vision of the dragon god of destruction <strong>Dahak</strong> manifests, and burns all the characters. Quan manages to find a way to divert the energy back at the manifestation to disable it. He'll be doing that a lot.</p>
<p>Through the portal at the end of the passageway, they find themselves in the Mwangi jungle, and are approached by a large number of Ekujae elves, including <strong>Jahsi</strong>. He says they are being troubled by cinderclaw cultists, and they have destroyed a white dragon pillar that was being erected here. He takes you to their village (called Akrivel, home to the leopard clan) and introduces you to his half-elf daughter <strong>Nketia</strong>. </p>
<p>A feast is arranged. Findir and Quan take part in a dancing game where you have to dance to a rhythm whilst trying to kick bells attached to your opponent's ankles. They succeed in the first match, but lose the second. Rab McNab goes hunting and impressively manages to find and kill a large waterbuck. He also tries to befriend the lioness that lives in the village and succeeds at the second attempt.</p>
<p>The team are brought to the clan leaders and manage to impress them with tales of their exploits and demonstrations of skill. During the feast, there is a spicy pepper eating contest, which Quan fails at but Findir succeeds at. Quan and Vejonica manage to convince Jahsi to admit his love for his friend Akosa.</p>
<p>Nketia tells a story:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a time of great darkness</li>
<li>The people stood against the darkness but could not damage it</li>
<li>The most righteous gave their lives to forge their souls into weapons</li>
<li>The people could not kill the darkness, but managed to force it back and trap it in the space between spaces</li>
<li>The Ekujae are sworn to stand guard so the darkness could not escape again</li>
</ul>
<p>Nketia says that there are now places in the jungle they cannot go without being struck by blindness. She asks VQFR to investigate and try to stop what is going on.</p>
<h2 id="pillars-of-ruin">Pillars of Ruin</h2>
<p>The team head east. They find a black dragon pillar being guarded by two charau-kas who have been infused with draconic features, but manage to defeat them and disable the pillar.</p>
<p>Heading south, they find a temple on the edge of a cliff, with an "explorer" <strong>Gerhard Pendergrast</strong> about to blow it up. They defuse the bombs and defeat him. They take the gunpowder barrels and put them in his bag of holding, which they take with them. Rab and Findir fight over who gets to keep his monacle. Heading south-west, the team find a green dragon pillar with a couple of jungle drakes, which they defeat. Further south-west, there is a blue pillar being dragged away by <strong>Erhard Pendergrast</strong>. The team kill him, and now they have two monocles, so Rab and Findir are happy. They also take his boat, which they can use to camp on and get about the jungle faster.</p>
<p>Hearing a disturbance to the north, they find a man holding a large sack. After his unconvincing lies about what is in the sack, they fight him (he turns out to be an evil fey) and rescue the earthbound angel inside.</p>
<p>Heading east along the river, they find the cinderclaw main base. Fighting a giant deinosuchus called <strong>Sweettooth</strong> involved Findir jumping on its back and stabbing it while everyone else tried to hit it from the boat. Eventually the team kill it, and Rab no doubt tries to skin it. I think they take some teeth as well. Realising that there is a barrier stopping them getting in to the base, they work out that destroying the dragon pillars will lower the barrier.</p>
<p>They head up the river and destroy two more dragon pillars (orange and red) and then find a giant mine. </p>
<h2 id="blood-for-gold">Blood for Gold</h2>
<p>VQFR scout the area and as well as the mine pit, they see some charau-kas next to a firepit, some sick boggards on some camp beds, a giant pile of dirt and a cage. Sneaking round the north of the mine pit, they defeat a vrock, and reach the cage which has a mokele-mbembe in it. Climbing up the giant pile of dirt, they are attacked by spiders. This raises the alarm, and once the spiders are defeated, the team is attacked by the cinderclaws and their leader, a kobold alchemist.</p>
<p>Once defeated, the team see a group of cinderclaws guarding the dragon pillar in the centre of the mine pit. Rab and Findir come up with a plan where they drop a barrel of gunpowder down to try to blow them up, which works very well. The remainder panic and start running up the slope, but Vejonica rolls the last barrel of gunpowder down the ramp and Rab shoots it with a flaming arrow. The team then mop up the remaining cinderclaws here and Quan disables the violet dragon pillar.</p>
<h2 id="legacy-of-ash-and-bone">Legacy of Ash and Bone</h2>
<p>Heading back to the cinderclaw HQ, the team break in through the front doors and fight a couple of clay golems, which turn out to be tricky to damage. The HQ itself appears to be made from the bones of a giant dragon. Fighting through the cinderclaws, they make it to the doors of the sanctum, which is protected by a very nasty magical trap. This would have killed Quan except for his cat's luck! In the room outside the ritual chamber, they find carvings of prayers to Dahak.</p>
<p>In the ritual chamber itself, they find an immense skull of a dragon with gold pouring from its mouth, which shoots fire at non-cinderclaws from its eyes.  A raised stone slab has a young red dragon called <strong>Kyrion</strong> is chained there, and the cinderclaw leader <strong>Belmazog</strong>  stands over him. Quan goes to disable to dragon skull by removing the magical ruby eyes. Findir unlocks Kyrion while Rab keeps Belmazog busy, and Vejonica tried to keep everyone healed. Eventually they succeed in killing her with Kyrion's help, and he is very grateful. There is a mysterious gold shard sticking through his chest. He promises to visit VQFR in Breachill soon.</p>
<p>Heading back to the village, the team meet back up with Nketia, who rewards them and gives them another magical artifact - the magical starknife Eclipse, which is a key to the <strong>Dreamgate</strong> portal. Heading back through the portal, the team get back to Hellknight Hill and arrange for more repairs to the castle, including a training room and fixing the walls.</p>
