<h2 id="the-road-to-kintargo">The Road to Kintargo</h2>
<p>The team receive a mysterious letter from <strong>Heuberk Thropp</strong> inviting them to meet at the shop of the local wainwright. VQFR go to meet him, and he proposes that they work together. He asks them to find three people that won't be missed, and will be excellent stock for the slave trade. VQFR refuse, and he retreats and sets off a trapped lathe. The team manage to disable the trap and attack and kill Heuberk and his cronies, and rescue the wainwright. </p>
<p>Making their was through the Dreamgate, the team find themselves in a waystation, which was once dedicated to the goddess of dreams, <strong>Desna</strong>. It has now been desecrated in Abyssal. Heading into the north passageway, they find a statue of a tree, which grabs everyone except Vejonica (who didn't enter the room). Quan manages to disable it, but not before three visions are seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vision of fighting a giant ice devil on a hillside</li>
<li>A vision of deafening bells</li>
<li>A vision of drowning in a quarry</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for the corruption becomes clear when the team see an Annis Hag and a Night Hag talking to a bone devil. When they realise they have been disturbed, the hags attack and the bone devil disappears. The team defeat the hags, and the bone devil appears to have gone to a different plane. Sneaking around the rest of the waystation, they see another night hag and a nightmare (fiery horse) which they decide to leave alone; the team go through the other portal.</p>
<p>Finding themselves on the edge of a small town called Cypress Point in the country of <strong>Ravounel</strong>, they realise that the town is under attack and there is a large boat at the quay. Fighting a group of slavers and rescuing a prisoner, they find out that the attackers are slavers associated somehow with the <strong>Scarlet Triad</strong>, previously thought to be a respectable group of traders and merchants. VQFR first go and fight the slavers on the quay and on the boat, including a kalavakus demon. They free the prisoners, and head to the smokehouse where the leader of this attack is on the roof, directing. He knocks Rab down and kicks him unconscious several times while Quan and Findir deal with his pet flame drakes. Eventually they are all defeated and the team free the town leaders. They then make sure that no fires are being set in the boathouse and defeat a couple of krooths.</p>
<p>With the town saved, they talk to a diplomat called <strong>Halleka Shadeborn</strong> from neighbouring <strong>Nidal</strong>, who wants to accompany them on their journey to the capital <strong>Kintargo</strong>. They decide to take the boat along the coast.</p>
<h2 id="shadows-on-the-silver-city">Shadows on the Silver City</h2>
<p>Once they reach Kintargo, they are directed to dock at the pier of <strong>Sunset Imports</strong>. Rather than sneak in, they decide to break down the doors - there is a fight between the team and some bruisers and another kalavakus demon. Vejonica entirely fails to push piles of crates over. Once defeated, you free a halfling called <strong>Hundy Vosht</strong> who tells them that he was tortured and revealed the location of the members and allies of the <strong>Bellweather Network</strong>, a secret society dedicated to abolishing slavery. They also are disturbed by <strong>Sedranni Vashnarstill</strong> who tells the team that she is the owner of Sunset Imports, and that she allied with the Scarlet Triad without knowing who they really were. They had taken over her building and she is very grateful to the team for dealing with them.</p>
<p>Heading to Kite Hill, the team meet <strong>Nolly Peltry</strong>, a halfling and leader of the Bellflower Network. She gives kites to the team for them to send coded messages and Findir does an exceptionally good job. However, at that moment a giant ice demon appears and attacks the locals, shouting "For the Umbral Lord!" and other praises of Nidal. The team defeat it (with Findir on its back again) and another halfling tells you that a wizard summoned the ice devil and he didn't look Nidalese. The team agrees to prevent rumours of a Nidalese attack. Rab tracks the wizard back towards town but loses the trail when they get to the stone road. </p>
<p>Heading to the Long Roads Coffeehouse, you find it has already been attacked. The team overcomes a bunch of spirits, and then find and defeat a couple of shapeshifting rakshasas. They rescue a halfling who tells them that a group of workers had been taken to <strong>Tanessen Tower</strong>. Rab takes a big bag of coffee with him.</p>
<p>At Lady Docur's school for girls, Findir makes a big mess of trying to charm Lady Docur. They find out that the school is actually secretly training girls in combat and is allied with the Bellflower Network. Because of this, the attackers were captured. The team agree that Lady Docur will discreetly dispose of the prisoners.</p>
<p>Heading to the tower, Findir interrupts some poisoners who are making jokes on the podium, and a fight ensues. On the next level, a fight with two alchemical golems leads to a lot of exploding capsules. After defeating some more poisoners and thugs, the team finally face the wizard <strong>Barushak</strong> along with his summoned velstracts. The team easily defeat him by plenty of use of the "Brexit Tackle" and take his notes, written in Infernal. Rescuing <strong>Laria Longroad</strong>, she tells you that other slaves have already been taken to <strong>Summershade Quarry</strong>, and she promises that the team will have free coffee for life.</p>
