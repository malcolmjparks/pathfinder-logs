<h2 id="the-road-to-kintargo">The Road to Kintargo</h2>
<p>The team receive a mysterious letter from <strong>Heuberk Thropp</strong> inviting them to meet at the shop of the local wainwright. VQFR go to meet him, and he proposes that they work together. He asks them to find three people that won't be missed, and will be excellent stock for the slave trade. VQFR refuse, and he retreats and sets off a trapped lathe. The team manage to disable the trap and attack and kill Heuberk and his cronies, and rescue the wainwright. </p>
<p>Making their was through the Dreamgate, the team find themselves in a waystation, which was once dedicated to the goddess of dreams, <strong>Desna</strong>. It has now been desecrated in Abyssal. Heading into the north passageway, they find a statue of a tree, which grabs everyone except Vejonica (who didn't enter the room). Quan manages to disable it, but not before three visions are seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vision of fighting a giant ice devil on a hillside</li>
<li>A vision of deafening bells</li>
<li>A vision of drowning in a quarry</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for the corruption becomes clear when the team see an Annis Hag and a Night Hag talking to a bone devil. When they realise they have been disturbed, the hags attack and the bone devil disappears. The team defeat the hags, and the bone devil appears to have gone to a different plane. Sneaking around the rest of the waystation, they see another night hag and a nightmare (fiery horse) which they decide to leave alone; the team go through the other portal.</p>
<p>Finding themselves on the edge of a small town called Cypress Point in the country of <strong>Ravounel</strong>, they realise that the town is under attack and there is a large boat at the quay. Fighting a group of slavers and rescuing a prisoner, they find out that the attackers are slavers associated somehow with the <strong>Scarlet Triad</strong>, previously thought to be a respectable group of traders and merchants. VQFR first go and fight the slavers on the quay and on the boat, including a kalavakus demon. They free the prisoners, and head to the smokehouse where the leader of this attack is on the roof, directing. He knocks Rab down and kicks him unconscious several times while Quan and Findir deal with his pet flame drakes. Eventually they are all defeated and the team free the town leaders. They then make sure that no fires are being set in the boathouse and defeat a couple of krooths.</p>
<p>With the town saved, they talk to a diplomat called <strong>Halleka Shadeborn</strong> from neighbouring <strong>Nidal</strong>, who wants to accompany them on their journey to the capital <strong>Kintargo</strong>. They decide to take the boat along the coast.</p>
<h2 id="shadows-on-the-silver-city">Shadows on the Silver City</h2>
<p>Once they reach Kintargo, they are directed to dock at the pier of <strong>Sunset Imports</strong>. Rather than sneak in, they decide to break down the doors - there is a fight between the team and some bruisers and another kalavakus demon. Vejonica entirely fails to push piles of crates over. Once defeated, you free a halfling called <strong>Hundy Vosht</strong> who tells them that he was tortured and revealed the location of the members and allies of the <strong>Bellweather Network</strong>, a secret society dedicated to abolishing slavery. They also are disturbed by <strong>Sedranni Vashnarstill</strong> who tells the team that she is the owner of Sunset Imports, and that she allied with the Scarlet Triad without knowing who they really were. They had taken over her building and she is very grateful to the team for dealing with them.</p>
<p>Heading to Kite Hill, the team meet <strong>Nolly Peltry</strong>, a halfling and leader of the Bellflower Network. She gives kites to the team for them to send coded messages and Findir does an exceptionally good job. However, at that moment a giant ice demon appears and attacks the locals, shouting "For the Umbral Lord!" and other praises of Nidal. The team defeat it (with Findir on its back again) and another halfling tells you that a wizard summoned the ice devil and he didn't look Nidalese. The team agrees to prevent rumours of a Nidalese attack. Rab tracks the wizard back towards town but loses the trail when they get to the stone road. </p>
<p>Heading to the Long Roads Coffeehouse, you find it has already been attacked. The team overcomes a bunch of spirits, and then find and defeat a couple of shapeshifting rakshasas. They rescue a halfling who tells them that a group of workers had been taken to <strong>Tanessen Tower</strong>. Rab takes a big bag of coffee with him.</p>
<p>At Lady Docur's school for girls, Findir makes a big mess of trying to charm Lady Docur. They find out that the school is actually secretly training girls in combat and is allied with the Bellflower Network. Because of this, the attackers were captured. The team agree that Lady Docur will discreetly dispose of the prisoners.</p>
<p>Heading to the tower, Findir interrupts some poisoners who are making jokes on the podium, and a fight ensues. On the next level, a fight with two alchemical golems leads to a lot of exploding capsules. After defeating some more poisoners and thugs, the team finally face the wizard <strong>Barushak</strong> along with his summoned velstracts. The team easily defeat him by plenty of use of the "Brexit Tackle" and take his notes, written in Infernal. Rescuing <strong>Laria Longroad</strong>, she tells you that other slaves have already been taken to <strong>Summershade Quarry</strong>, and she promises that the team will have free coffee for life.</p>
<h2 id="the-cornered-quarry">The Cornered Quarry</h2>
<p>VQFR drop by Lady Docur's school for girls again and manage to meet up with Findir's 3rd cousin 4 times removed - an elf monk called <strong>Baba Ganoush</strong>. Lady Docur wants him to accompany the team to help root out the slavers from the country. The team head south for a couple of days until they get to a small town, where the mayor / landowner admits that the quarry was abandoned partly because the workers found a strange cave that they believe to be haunted.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the quarry, Quan and Rab check the guards, and find out that they have been dead for a while and have been posed to look like nothing is wrong. The team head into a lookout cave, where they surprise a bunch of thugs who were gambling when they should have been on lookout. The team kill these guards, but then another set of guards finds them. Baba is practicing his grappling quite a lot, and one of the guards ends up slowed, clumsy and confused. Once the toughest guard goes down, the others surrender.</p>
<p>Leaving the remaining guards tied up, the team then progress through a tunnel in the side of the quarry until they reach a sleeping chamber with beds big enough for giants - and there are indeed four giants there. A fight ensues, and the giants fight fanatically to the death.</p>
<p>Round the corner, they find a set of four large ghastly bears who look like they are guarding the entrance to another chamber. The team take them by surprise and quickly overwhelm the bears. Due to some comically low perception checks, the lich and his two giant assistants do not notice the fight and are also taken by surprise. The fight is quickly over as Baba, Vejonica and Quan overwhelm the lich and destroy his current body before he can react, and Findir and Rab manage to take out the two remaining giants. With this area now clear, Rab and Baba prise some emeralds out of some wall carvings while Vejonica heals everyone.</p>
<p>The team continue round the quarry and find a chamber with some poisoners and an alchemical golem. Rab takes the opportunity to practice his bowmanship and lets off a few volleys. Baba and Quan both Brexit tackle a poisoner each, and Findir goes and attacks the golem, for which he gets an electricity bomb going off in his face. Rather miffed by this, he then Brexit tackles Baba for some reason. Vejonica has to intervene with a spell to make everyone think Baba is fatally wounded to calm things down.</p>
<p>Once these enemies are defeated, the team go through to a luxuriously decorated room where a man lounges on a couch smoking a pipe and pondering a game board. He invites the team to take a look, and then surprises them by flipping the board over which releases a couple of greater shadows, while he transforms into a fiend in the shape of a gorilla. With things looking a bit perilous, Vejonica tries to cast Celestial Accord, and the field critically fails his will save and becomes friendly. Vejonica convinces his to join in with the fight against the greater shadows, which now becomes a cake-walk. Once defeated, Rab then convinces the fiend to take a drink of a refreshing tonic - which does quite a lot of damage to him - and everyone takes a shot at him to finish him off, a la Julius Caeser. Having a look around the room, the team "salvage" four bottles of fine wine, plus another bottle of less-than-fine wine, a bottle a sake, and some fancy rugs. In the next chamber, they find the currently empty nest of <strong>Laslunn</strong>, a knoll and leader of the Scarlet Triad in Kintargo, which Vejonica recognises as being from Katapesh.</p>
