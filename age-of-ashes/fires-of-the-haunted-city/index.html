<h2 id="echoes-of-the-dead">Echoes of the Dead</h2>
<p>After going through Jewelgate, the team find a small waystation room with crystals growing and the ghost of an elf welcoming them and warning that the crystals are dangerous. She seems to have memory problems. Luckily, Findir insults her and she flies into a rage, incapacitating several of the team with a shriek of crushing despair. In between sobs, the team manage to defeat her before approaching the crystals, which lash out with energy also causing despair. The team manage to disable the crystals though and Baba picks up some interesting books.</p>
<p>Going through the other gate of the waystation, the team find themselves in a cave with more crystals and some strange tunnels. Two of the crystals have formed sentent ooze-like creatures, which attack. The team fight back, but the oozes keep splitting in half. At one point, Vejonica is engulfed by one of the oozes which starts to turn her into a crystal ooze too. She panics and casts a level 6 sound burst to try to break free, which almost kills the ooze but not quite. Baba comes to her rescue and saves her while the others finish the other oozes off.</p>
<p>Travelling through the tunnel, a cave worm suddenly attacks. Findir thinks this is the ideal time to get swallowed, and Quan thinks this is such a great idea that he will try too. They both take damage while being swallowed. The cave worm also thinks this is a good idea, as it can regurgitate them and fire them out - Findir gets fired at Rab, who manages to duck out the way, while Quan gets fired at Vejonica who is not so lucky. Rab and Baba meanwhile have been doing a bunch of damage to the worm (and Baba manages to intimidate it somehow), and Vejonica finishes it off with a well-placed fireball.</p>
<p>Going further along the passage leads to a large wall with a crack in it just large enough to squeeze through. Rab sends his warg animal companion warg through the crack to scope out the scene, and he sees two gugs cheering on a giant bat who is tearing into some ghoul bodies. The team try to sneak in through the crack, but the gugs spot them and come in to attack with great ferocity. Vejonica heals herself after taking considerable damage, and Baba takes this opportunity to do a wall run, jumping on to the giant bat and choking it until it falls unconscious. Rab then manacles it. With one of the gugs falling under repeated attacks, the other gug runs for help, opening the door at the for side of the chamber and running down the hall. A cloud of fungus spores are thrown up in its wake as it reaches three more gugs who were lounging in the next chamber.</p>
<p>Findir gives chase, also throwing up spores which choke Baba, and Vejonica stars casting fireballs left, right and centre. Rab fires some arrows from afar, then goes back to perform a coup de grace on the giant bat. Baba clears some of the fungus out the way, but Quan decides to follow Findir's course and also runs through the fungus, choking more of the team with spores. Taking out two more gugs, the last gug pounds on the door asking for help. The chief gug comes bursting in and growling in a language that nobody in the team understands. He doesn't last long, with some heavy blows raining down on him and a finisher with some panache from Findir.</p>
<p>With the gugs all dead, the team spend some time to clear out the fungus, recover and heal. After a while, they explore a bit more and find a trapped ghast named <strong>Deadmouth</strong>, who tells them they are in the ancient city city of <strong>Saggorak</strong>. After freeing him, he relates that the city was once a great Dwarven kingdom, but was besieged by an orc army centuries ago and the dwarves fell - with a lot of them turning into undead (ghouls, ghasts, ghosts and other unsavoury types) which ironically wiped out the orc army. However, later (but still a long time ago), a small portion of the city was taken back by the dwarves and is now known as <strong>Kovlar</strong>. He recommends that the team seek shelter there, or face the wrath of the "Molten King" of Saggorak, a dragon called <strong>Veshumirix</strong>. At this point, he tries to make a break for it, but Baba kills him with a single blow.</p>
<p>Emerging into the city, the team are hailed by a dwarven scout called <strong>Parjil Longbraid</strong>, who says she was observing the gugs and trying to work out what to do about them. She is alarmed at the mention of draconic activity, and guides the team on the hour-long trek to Kovlar, the only light in the city other than the glow of Rab's halo. On the way, the team see the devastation of Saggorak, but also learn that Kovlar is known for high-quality armour and weapons. However, the two elves in the team may find themselves in hot water if they do not control their obvious disdain for dwarves!</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-kovlar">Welcome to Kovlar</h2>
<p>The party are presented to the <strong>Court of Regents</strong> in Kovlar. The current speaker and leader of the Guild of Anvillers - <strong>Kelda Halrig</strong> - welcomes them to Kovlar, and thanks them for dealing with the gugs. They court asks why they are here, and how they got in to Saggorak, and Rab explains - though with some interruption from Findir who insists that they really just want treasure.</p>
<p>Each of the ten regents of the guild then ask each member of the team a question, which they can answer directly or by demonstrating something that they think will impress that regent. Seven of the ten are impressed enough that they accept that the team will be able to help Kovlar, and gift some items to help with the jobs that they will give out.</p>

<h5 id="deep-terror">Deep Terror</h5>
<p>Taking on a job for the Guild of Arms, the team investigate the Bluecrab lake, where Vejonica determines that the crabs are being poisoned. Rab expertly pilots the boat towards the spawning grounds, and luckily sees a couple of gigantic lake serpents approaching. Findir teleports on to the back of one, which promptly swallows him. The other capsizes the boat and swallows Vejonica. Findir cuts his way free from the inside of the lake serpent, which by this time has targeted a flying Rab McNab, infecting him with a hallucinogenic fungus which causes him to fire arrows at random targets. Vejonica bursts free from the belly of the second serpent, twice her normal size, glowing with fire and holding a flaming scimitar. She gets shot at by Rab. Baba pummels one of serpents, and is also shot at by Rab. Findir hides under the capsized boat. Eventually the serpents are defeated and the team head back to shore to patch themselves up and report their findings.</p>
<h5 id="theft-from-the-vaults">Theft from the Vaults</h5>
<p>The inevitable guard claims Fortunate Algera Kord took the missing runestone. The logs of borrowing for the relevant night are missing. Only regents can enter the vault. The team go to the casino to confront Fortunate Algera Kord, who gives the team her alibi, and also tells them in confidence that her house was broken in to. Rab is at one of the tables of the casino, cigar in his mouth and playing poker. Investigating Algera's house, Quan notices that her lockbox has been picked, and Findir notices human footprints outside, leading north.</p>
<h5 id="a-curious-expedition">A Curious Expedition</h5>
<p>Archmage Hromgar Nalruven wished to see the elf-gate. On the way there, the party get a little lost and are ambushed by a gogiteth, that they eventually defeat. Hromgar remains in Breachill for a while, learning about the area. He teaches Findir a lighting bolt spell as thanks for escorting him and showing him the gate.</p>
<h5 id="shady-dealings">Shady Dealings</h5>
<p>To settle a dispute between the Anvillers' Guild and some merchants, the team inspect a selection of goods. Baba manages to spot a common design amongst flawed goods. The team bring a selection of smiths along and ask them to pick out their best work - a dwarf smith called Brigven picks out one of the flawed weapons, and when confronted by this, he dithers until Baba intimidates him into spilling the beans. He claims agents of <strong>Droskar</strong> blackmailed him, and they are also working to bring down the city.</p>
<h5 id="missing-persons">Missing Persons</h5>
<p>A missing dwarf called Algret left a note that seems unlikely to be written by her given her personality. The party notice that is is a forgery, and ask around town for information. Some people noticed her heading north at some point before disappearing. Two dwarf guards are spotted following the party, and when confronted they claim they are investigating the team and they are suspicious of their activities. Questioning Commander Grokar Hammersong leads them to think these guards may be rogue, as there are no orders for guards to follow the party.</p>
<h5 id="chiselrocks-prison">Chiselrock's Prison</h5>
<p>The team evade the guards following them and follow them back to their base. Other guards come out and head off into the city. Baba goes to fetch help, and Quan picks the lock to go in. Quan, Findir and Vejonica rush in and take the remaining guards by surprise - but it's a close battle, with Quan reduced to 1 hit point. Eventually the guards are defeated, and the team investigate the building. They find lots of evidence of Chiselrock paying people off, undermining other members of the guild and general no-good. They also find Algret, who tells them she was a spy tasked with rooting out corruption and had been captured when she was investigating the building. Commander Grokar is very pleased to rescue her.</p>
<p>Baba summons the other guild leaders, and confronts Chiselrock with the evidence. He blusters, but as he sees his plans fall apart he concedes defeat and is arrested and led away. Among the evidence gathered is confirmation that there is a hidden temple of Droskar in the city, which is forbidden - and links to Ilssrah Embermead.</p>
<h5 id="the-hidden-forge">The Hidden Forge</h5>
<p>Following up on rumours and tracks, the party discover the secret entrance to a hidden temple of Droskar under an abandoned building. Entering the entrance way, the party is attacked by two stone golems that were guarding the doors. As they defeat one, a Duergar (dark dwarf) and a human attack, but are outclassed by some impressive fighting by the team.</p>
<p>Exploring some of the rest of the building, they discover some bunks with some exhausted dwarf slaves, and more dwarf slaves working hard to turn a mill wheel that does nothing other than make noise and smoke - typical of Droskar. Freeing the slaves, one of them says he is from Kovlar and will guide the others to a nearby temple of Torag for healing. Most of the other slaves say that they were brought here through a tunnel in the forge from Saggorak by slavers led by Ilssrah Embermead. They also warn of a large undead guardian in the forge. The giant forge-spawned monster takes some beating, but the party are successful.</p>
<h2 id="into-the-haunted-city">Into the Haunted City</h2>
<p>Following a long passageway leading from the hidden forge, the party feel like they are probably leaving Kovlar by going under the city walls, and are now under Saggorak. Reaching a set of doors, they open them to find a few Scarlet Triad cultists sparring. The party rush in to attack, and Rab opens a grate on the floor which leads to a lava pit 50 feet below. After shoving one of the cultists down to his death, Rab is then tripped and also falls down the shaft, before managing to grab on to a ledge halfway down. Another cultist is shoved into the pit and grabs hold of Rab's leg. Rab makes the decision to fly down the shaft until the cultist lets go and falls into the lava, using his fire resistance to his advantage. He then flies back up the shaft just in time to see Baba return with the last remaining cultist (who was trying to escape) and throw them into the pit as well.</p></div>
