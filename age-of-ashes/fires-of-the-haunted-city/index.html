<h2 id="echoes-of-the-dead">Echoes of the Dead</h2>
<p>After going through Jewelgate, the team find a small waystation room with crystals growing and the ghost of an elf welcoming them and warning that the crystals are dangerous. She seems to have memory problems. Luckily, Findir insults her and she flies into a rage, incapacitating several of the team with a shriek of crushing despair. In between sobs, the team manage to defeat her before approaching the crystals, which lash out with energy also causing despair. The team manage to disable the crystals though and Baba picks up some interesting books.</p>
<p>Going through the other gate of the waystation, the team find themselves in a cave with more crystals and some strange tunnels. Two of the crystals have formed sentent ooze-like creatures, which attack. The team fight back, but the oozes keep splitting in half. At one point, Vejonica is engulfed by one of the oozes which starts to turn her into a crystal ooze too. She panics and casts a level 6 sound burst to try to break free, which almost kills the ooze but not quite. Baba comes to her rescue and saves her while the others finish the other oozes off.</p>
<p>Travelling through the tunnel, a cave worm suddenly attacks. Findir thinks this is the ideal time to get swallowed, and Quan thinks this is such a great idea that he will try too. They both take damage while being swallowed. The cave worm also thinks this is a good idea, as it can regurgitate them and fire them out - Findir gets fired at Rab, who manages to duck out the way, while Quan gets fired at Vejonica who is not so lucky. Rab and Baba meanwhile have been doing a bunch of damage to the worm (and Baba manages to intimidate it somehow), and Vejonica finishes it off with a well-placed fireball.</p>
<p>Going further along the passage leads to a large wall with a crack in it just large enough to squeeze through. Rab sends his warg animal companion warg through the crack to scope out the scene, and he sees two gugs cheering on a giant bat who is tearing into some ghoul bodies. The team try to sneak in through the crack, but the gugs spot them and come in to attack with great ferocity. Vejonica heals herself after taking considerable damage, and Baba takes this opportunity to do a wall run, jumping on to the giant bat and choking it until it falls unconscious. Rab takes this opportunity to manacle it. With one of the gugs falling under repeated attacks, the other gug runs for help, opening the door at the for side of the chamber and running down the hall. A cloud of fungus spores are thrown up in its wake as it reaches three more gugs who were lounging in the next chamber.</p>
<p>Findir gives chase, also throwing up spores which choke Baba, and Vejonica stars casting fireballs left, right and centre. Rab fires some arrows from afar, then goes back to perform a coup de grace on the giant bat. Baba clears some of the fungus out the way, but Quan decides to follow Findir's course and also runs through the fungus, choking more of the team with spores. Taking out two more gugs, the last gug pounds on the door asking for help. The chief gug comes bursting in and growling in a language that nobody in the team understands. He doesn't last long, with some heavy blows raining down on him and a finisher with some panache from Findir.</p>
<p>With the gugs all dead, the team spend some time to clear out the fungus, recover and heal. After a while, they explore a bit more and find a trapped ghast named <strong>Deadmouth</strong>, who tells them they are in the ancient city city of <strong>Saggorak</strong>. After freeing him, he relates that the city was once a great Dwarven kingdom, but was besieged by an orc army centuries ago and the dwarves fell - with a lot of them turning into undead (ghouls, ghasts, ghosts and other unsavoury types) which ironically wiped out the orc army. However, later (but still a long time ago), a small portion of the city was taken back by the dwarves and is now known as <strong>Kovlar</strong>. He recommends that the team seek shelter there, or face the wrath of the "Molten King" of Saggorak, a dragon called <strong>Veshumirix</strong>. At this point, he tries to make a break for it, but Baba kills him with a single blow.</p>
<p>Emerging into the city, the team are hailed by a dwarven scout called <strong>Parjil Longbraid</strong>, who says she was observing the gugs and trying to work out what to do about them. She is alarmed at the mention of draconic activity, and guides the team on the hour-long trek to Kovlar, the only light in the city other than the glow of Rab's halo. On the way, the team see the devastation of Saggorak, but also learn that Kovlar is known for high-quality armour and weapons. However, the two elves in the team may find themselves in hot water if they do not control their obvious disdain for dwarves!</p>
