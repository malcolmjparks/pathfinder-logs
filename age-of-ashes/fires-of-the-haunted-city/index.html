<p>After going through Jewelgate, the team find a small waystation room with crystals growing and the ghost of an elf welcoming them and warning that the crystals are dangerous. She seems to have memory problems. Luckily, Findir insults her and she flies into a rage, incapacitating several of the team with a shriek of crushing despair. In between sobs, the team manage to defeat her before approaching the crystals, which lash out with energy also causing despair. The team manage to disable the crystals though and Baba picks up some interesting books.</p>
<p>Going through the other gate of the waystation, the team find themselves in a cave with more crystals and some strange tunnels. Two of the crystals have formed sentent ooze-like creatures, which attack. The team fight back, but the oozes keep splitting in half. At one point, Vejonica is engulfed by one of the oozes which starts to turn her into a crystal ooze too. She panics and casts a level 6 sound burst to try to break free, which almost kills the ooze but not quite. Baba comes to her rescue and saves her while the others finish the other oozes off.</p>
<p>Travelling through the tunnel, a cave worm suddenly attacks. Findir thinks this is the ideal time to get swallowed, and Quan thinks this is such a great idea that he will try too. They both take damage while being swallowed. The cave worm also thinks this is a good idea, as it can regurgitate them and fire them out - Findir gets fired at Rab, who manages to duck out the way, while Quan gets fired at Vejonica who is not so lucky. Rab and Baba meanwhile have been doing a bunch of damage to the worm (and Baba manages to intimidate it somehow), and Vejonica finishes it off with a well-placed fireball.</p>
<p>Going further along the passage leads to a large wall with a crack in it just large enough to squeeze through...</p>
