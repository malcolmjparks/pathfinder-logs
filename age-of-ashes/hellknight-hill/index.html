<h2 id="the-councils-chosen">The Council's Chosen</h2>
<p>There is a "Call for heroes" in Breachill. Quan and Findir already know each other and engage in some boxing in the pub before being joined by Vejonica and Rab McNab and heading to City Hall. The goblin <strong>Warbal Bumblebrasher</strong>  is asking for help because there's red smoke above Hellknight Hill and she's lost contact with the local goblin tribe. </p>
<p>At that moment, a fire elemental bursts in and City Hall catches fire. Vejonica uses her Bullhorn spell to co-ordinate helping everyone leave safely, while Quan, Findir and Rab McNab defeat the elemental. Everyone organises a bucket line and manages to put out the fire. The leader of the council finds out that a halfling <strong>Calmont</strong> set the fire and then ran towards Hellknight Hill. VQFR agree to find him and bring him back to face justice.</p>
<h2 id="the-ruined-citadel">The Ruined Citadel</h2>
<p>VQFR climb into the ruined castle through one of the collapsed walls. They explore and find a silver sword. In a ceremony room, they find <strong>Alak Stagram</strong> who asks for help defeating a couple of imps. Once done, he says he is a member of the Order of the Nail, and a trainee Hellknight. The Hellknights used to be based here, but they moved to Varisia. He's here on personal business looking for his family's signet ring. He leaves and goes his own way.</p>
<p>After fighting a bugbear thug and some spiders, VQFR hear noise coming from the courtyard. They fight a large crocodile-like grauladon, which Vejonica recognises as being from a jungle, and not native to this area at all. Rab McNab tries to skin it. The stairs up to the battlements and down to the vaults are collapsed. </p>
<p>Everyone sees a standoff between Calmont and the goblins on the ramparts. VQFR climb up, and Vejonica uses a spell to calm Calmont and the others subdue him. The goblins are very grateful, but say they have been kicked out of their usual living quarters by the sudden appearance of cultists that call themselves the <strong>Cinderclaws</strong>. The goblins ask the team to deal with them, and let them know about the secret entrance. Calmont says the reason he is there is because he found out about <strong>Alseta's Ring</strong>, a series of Elf Gates from his boss <strong>Voz</strong> and he wants to make money from it. Calmont is taken back to town.</p>
<p>The players return to the castle, now knowing that if they find the deed to the castle, they will take ownership of it. They search the rest of the ground floor, fight some skeletons and find some more silver weapons. They adopt some warg puppies and start to train them.</p>
<h2 id="the-citadel-below">The Citadel Below</h2>
<p>Going through the secret entrance, they fight some emperor birds, which are also jungle natives. The team also fight a soulbound doll, a gelatinous cube, and find a couple of kobalds with delusions of grandeur. They also fight some frog-like boggards and baboon-like charau-kas who all have a red claw motif on their armour. Going in to the hall of graves, the team find a skeletal hellknight and some skeletal guards, and defeating them means they can explore and find better weapons and equipment which had been entombed with important Hellknights in the past.</p>
<p>VQFR find Alak again, who finds his ring and is pleased when given a book that was written by his father. The team find a tunnel that leads back to town and into the basement of a pub. Interviewing the pub owner, they find out that Voz had been using the tunnel but has recently stopped.</p>
<h2 id="breachills-secrets">Breachill's Secrets</h2>
<p>The team go to Voz's shop, and find some interesting notes written in the margins of the "Breachill, outpost of Liberty" book. The book says the town was founded by a wizard called Breachton. He found a large group of people who had all lost their memory - he looked after them and founded the town to keep them safe. Voz notes "Ha! Idiot humans trusting that lying wizard - the fools put up a statue of that duplicitous charlatan". They also find a note reading "Entrance to Alseta's Ring - Guardian's Way."</p>
<p>VQFR head to Guardian's way, where there are a bunch of half-orc guards on platforms in the trees. After defeating them and their hobgoblin leader, they head into the tunnels. They fight Voz and defeat her.</p>
<p>Heading deeper into the tunnels, they feel they are headed back towards Hellknight Hill. They fight some spiders and an insane barghest who has goblin skeletons posed in positions of worship. A half-spider half-human anandi called <strong>Renali</strong> joins the fight on the players' side. She said she came through an elf-gate with the cinderclaws (who she hates) to try to stop them, and got stranded along with them when the gate closed.</p>
<p>The team and Renali head down to the lowest level, and defeat the cinderclaw leader here, <strong>Malarunk</strong> - who was carrying a magical hunter's arrowhead that is used to open <strong>Huntergate</strong>. They find Alseta's Ring, and a vault which has a door-warden that will attack if someone tries to go through the door. Findir takes an invisibility potion and goes and grabs everything from the room, including the deed to the castle.</p>
<p>The team get handsome reward for clearing out the castle and bringing Calmont to justice. Over the next few days, Rab organises masons, workmen and craftsmen to start repairing the stairs, clearing out the junk and building livable quarters.</p>
<p>Findir fixes Huntergate and touching the arrowhead to it opens a portal.</p></div>
