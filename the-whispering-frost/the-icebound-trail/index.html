    <h1 id="the-icebound-trail">The Icebound Trail</h1>
<h2 id="blood-in-the-streets">Blood in the Streets</h2>
<p>Arriving back at the back entrance of the Clover Club, the investigators bring in the bootleg alcohol and the idols that they have collected. Seamus is angry about the death of Grady, but is intrigued by the idols. He tells the team that Grady had heard that the Sheldons had done something to disrupt the O'Bannion supply lines, and had captured something that would give some extra information.</p>
<p>At this moment, the team hear a shot from outdoors and three thugs burst through the door. The leader takes cover behind a table and fires his Tommy Gun at Adelei, who goes down injured. His two associates take cover and start firing their pistols, but the team manage to take them down - with Dan beheading the leader with his machete. Searching the bodies, they find some strange silver coins and a silk bulletproof vest. McG takes the Tommy Gun from the body of the leader, who turns out to be Clarence Sheldon. The bodies look like they have not eaten for a few days, and their fingers are purple.</p>
<p>Seamus is shocked that the Sheldons would start a full-on gang war, and wants the team to find out what is going on - and prevent more bloodshed if possible. McG also has a contact that he can go to to find out more about the silver coins, which have some strange markings and look very old.</p>
<h2 id="hibbs-roadhouse">Hibb's Roadhouse</h2>
<p>After phoning to arrange a meeting with the Sheldons, the team drive up to Hibb's Roadhouse, which is a couple of miles outside the city. With a couple of heavies outside preventing entry until the team give up their weapons, McG decides to stay in the car to keep watch. Dan tries to smuggle a pistol in, but it is found.</p>
<p>Inside, the team meet with <strong>Sadie Sheldon</strong>, the matriarch of the gang. She tells them that Clarence came to her a couple of weeks ago very pleased with himself. He said he had a way to disrupt the O'Bannions and give the Sheldons an edge - but after that he started acting strangely and they lost contact. She offers a reward for the return of the gun, and also says that she does not want a full-on gang war, and is willing to make a deal with the O'Bannions to find out who did this to her nephew.</p>
<p>Adelei convinces her that they don't have the gun, but Peter lets slip that they do have it. Sadie snaps her fingers and her heavies move to block the three investigators inside, while the two outside approach McG and ask him to bring the gun in. He does, and Sadie gives them a reward of $200. The team use the money to pay for another Tommy Gun from the O'Bannions.</p>
<h2 id="the-idols-curse">The Idol's Curse</h2>
<p>Heading to McG's contact's house - <strong>Professor Amos Derwin's</strong>, they find the professor in a panic and the house barricaded shut. McG and Peter manage to convince him to let them in, and Amos relates his tale. He had been approached a couple of weeks ago by some thugs who wanted to know all about The Wind-Walker, and how they might use idols in a ritual. He also notes that the coins are related to the mythical land of Hyperborea, where the Wind-Walker / Ithaqua is imprisoned after rebelling against the other Ancient Ones.</p>
<p>At this point, there is a scream from outside, and something tries to smash through the front door. Failing to gain entrance there, there is a crash from other windows until another Frozen Berserker bursts through the kitchen window. It attacks the investigators, and Amos hides under the sofa. Once the berserker is defeated, Amos gives a book of spells to Adelei, who uses it to gain a vision of Hyperborea - he sees the giant figure of Ithaqua imprisoned and chained, but at that moment he pulls at the chain and frees his left hand. He also recognises the map that Grady had, and suggest that it shows the location of the ritual site used to activate the idols. It's about four hours drive north, plus a trek into the wilderness.</p>
<h2 id="ambush-on-the-trail">Ambush on the Trail</h2>
<p>Selling the silver coins to Miskatonic University and using the cash to buy tents and survival equipment, the team head north. After four hours, they park the car and set off on foot. When the sun sets, the team set up camp. Taking it in turns to take watch, McG is on guard when a trio of Wendigos approach the camp. He wakes the others, and retreats to near the fire to gain some protection. Adelei and Peter rush out, while Dan takes is time and eventually comes out in his underwear. The Wendigos rush in and knock over Adelei and McG.</p>
<p>The Wendigos are hurt by the investigators, but seem to recover health. Once two of them are defeated, Adelei throws a burning branch at the remaining one which seems to stop the health recovery. Eventually all three are killed, and the team take some time to recover and heal their injuries. The next morning, they press on towards the ritual site.</p>
