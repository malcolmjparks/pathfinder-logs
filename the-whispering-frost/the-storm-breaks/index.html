    <h1 id="the-storm-breaks">The Storm Breaks</h1>
<h2 id="the-frosts-reach">The Frost's Reach</h2>
<p>Heading back to Arkham, the investigators notice that their fingers are turning purple as they handle the strange silver coins. Adelei has a vision of cultists placing silver coins on the foreheads of people tied down on a large altar. They decide to head to Miskatonic University to consult Amos Derwin. He is in his office and is nervous about opening the door, but upon seeing McG he lets the team in. They start to discuss the coins, and Amos is intrigued by the news that they bring, but at that moment they hear a crash from Amos's storage room next door.</p>
<p>Entering the room, they find four cultists, who appear to have raided the room specifically for the silver coins. Three of them seem to have a coin somehow stuck to their forehead, and the last one appears to stick a coin to his forehead as they enter. Two of the cultists then cast a spell that causes injury and panic especially for McG, and the team open fire with all their weapons. Amos is distressed by the damage to his specimens, but is also incensed by people stealing his artifacts so he also joins in with the shooting. Eventually all the cultists die - and Amos then has a panic attack about the four dead bodies now in his rooms. Adelei cuts the coins from the foreheads of the cultists, and McG calls Seamus to try to arrange a cleanup crew. As he relates the tale of what has happened in the office, he hears sudden crashes and bangs from the Clover Club and Seamus shouts "We're under attack!" before the line goes dead.</p>
<h2 id="trouble-at-the-clover-club">Trouble at the Clover Club</h2>
<p>The investigators decide to head straight to the Clover Club to help. As they burst in, they see Seamus with two goons firing at a group of six wendigos from a temporary barricade. Adelei rushes in to cast Blinding Light, which affects four of the wendigos, and then the rest of the team fire at will. After taking one of the wendigos down, another cast of Blinding Light affects everyone. Amos is affected so much that he cannot assist for a while.</p>
<p>Once all of the wendigos are down, Seamus expresses amazement that the team managed to take them out - as the wendigos has continued to heal up until that point. Peter noticed that the onyx idol glimmered slightly every time a wendigo was injured. Seamus then seems very interested in this idol...</p>
