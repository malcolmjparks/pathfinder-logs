    <h1 id="the-frozen-warning">The Frozen Warning</h1>
<p>Blizzards have been plaguing Massachusetts. Some people are starting to suspect that something is amiss, because they have never been this fierce and unrelenting before. Rumours are starting to spread about voices on the wind - people are calling it the Whispering Frost - and some locals are disappearing without a trace. Supplies are running low, and the local gangs are using this opportunity to fill their coffers with supply work - both legal and illegal.</p>
<h2 id="silent-signals">Silent Signals</h2>
<p>Seamus O'Bannion has hired a couple of freelancers - the hitman <strong>Peter Gill</strong> and paranormal investigator <strong>McG</strong> - to help cook and supplier <strong>Adelei</strong> and enforcer <strong>Dan Pacho</strong> to recover some key supplies, bootlegged alcohol and some "extra items" that <strong>Grady Mills</strong> should have delivered. He is normally reliable, but he has gone strangely silent since his last message, which ended with a garbled "... the winds".</p>
<p>Peter and Adelei test out driving the van, and both of them have trouble manoeuvering, but once they get on the road, Peter gets the hang of it. Which is lucky, because a fierce blizzard comes down suddenly about 45 minutes into the drive, and after hitting some ice on the road, he managed to stop the van from crashing, and instead drives it down a drive to an old barn, with the wind seeming to push them towards it. As he and Dan open the barn doors to get the van sheltered inside, McG investigates the barn.</p>
<p>Picking up a strange black idol, McG hears whispers and sees a flash of a snow-covered wilderness where unnatural shapes stalk the landscape. Turning round to tell everyone else, a Cold Shadow emerges from the idol and attacks. The investigators manage to bring it down without too much trouble, and the blizzard outside seems to die down. Driving on to Grady's hideout, McG and Adelei examine the idol, and think it may have a connection to <strong>Ithaqua</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-howling-woods">The Howling Woods</h2>
<p>At the hideout, Peter and Dan go inside to investigate while McG and Adelei scout the perimeter. Inside, they find some notes and a map with the words "The Storm's Eye", and notice that it is colder inside than outside. They find the goods, but not any "extra items" - meanwhile outside Adelei finds a single set of footprints leading into the woods. The team decides to follow.</p>
<p>At an old trapper's camp they find as they follow the tracks, the investigators are ambushed by four Frostbitten Wolves, which seem to rise out of the snow. They attach Dan and Adelei, both of whom are knocked prone and Adelei is injured as well. However, the team manage to defeat them and Adelei patches himself up.</p>
<h2 id="gradys-last-stand">Grady's Last Stand</h2>
<p>The trail leads to a clearing in the woods where the frozen corpse of Grady stands with a shotgun in his hands. Around him, his journal and a crate lie half-buried in the snow. The journal nearby Grady’s belief that something is stalking the region - “The <strong>Wind-Walker</strong>,” a local myth tied to strange totems he had recently intercepted from a rival smuggling group. As Peter tries to grab the shotgun from Grady's hands, his body rises up into the air and comes alive, with ice claws forming on his hands, and a blizzard forming around them.</p>
<p>The Frostbound Berserker attacks, flinging ice at the investigators and letting off a horrific shriek. The team manage to take him down with some find shooting, a machete chop and a blinding light. The blizzard dies down.</p>
<p>The crate contains another black totem, with a note from Grady reading "Burn it or he will find you." With the goods obtained, the investigators load up the van and head back to Arkham...</p>
