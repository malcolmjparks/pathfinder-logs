    <h1 id="the-frozen-dead">The Frozen Dead</h1>
<h2 id="the-ritual-site">The Ritual Site</h2>
<p>Reaching the ritual site, the investigators take a look around - a crumbling stone circle in a snow-laden clearing, radiating an unnatural chill. They find the scorched remnants of a ritual fire, scattered silver coins, and clawed tracks leading away. Adelei discovers a ritual knife, blackened with dried blood.</p>
<p>As they follow the tracks, three Cold Stalkers emerge from the nearby woods and attack. McG blasts one away with his Tommy gun, and Adelei manages to banish the other two.</p>
<h2 id="the-abandoned-lodge">The Abandoned Lodge</h2>
<p>At the lodge, the team search for clues, initially finding a scrap of paper that indicating that Clarence was desperate to "bind the Wind-Walker’s favor" for the Sheldons. At this moment, they trigger a hidden ward carved into the lodge’s structure, and summon two spectral guardians known as Whispering Wraiths. Dan attacks with his machete as Adelei uses his banishment spell again to great effect, though he is also filled with terror and has to run into the corner of the room and hide. Luckily, there he finds Clarence’s journal which states that the ritual was incomplete, and he sought more power by summoning a <strong>Messenger of the Storm</strong>.</p>
<p>Adelei thens takes this opportunity to perform a spell to gain a vision of Hyperborea - and is surprised to see Ithaqua communicating somehow with a tall spectral figure, which his vision shows is in a cave nearby.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-the-messenger">Meeting the Messenger</h2>
<p>The investigators trek to the cave, where they find jagged icicles and Hyperborean runes glowing faintly in the dark. Inside, the air is bitterly cold, and a constant wind howls through the tunnels. The walls are lined with strange carvings depicting figures bowing to a towering, faceless being. McG determines that the figures and probably making some kind of deal with the being and gaining powers in return for some favour.</p>
<p>Further in, they find an altar covered in frost, surrounded by shattered silver coins and a faintly glowing black idol. The scene exudes an overwhelming sense of dread. As the investigators approach, a spectral figure materializes — the Messenger of the Storm, that Adelei saw in his vision. Initially the Messenger is pleased to see them, and mentions that they are now part of the Wind Walker's plan. It laments that the last people to come here were not strong enough, though they were used by binding their will to Ithaqua anyway. It thanks the investigators for returning the idols, and reaches forward to take them.</p>
<p>Peter decides that this is a step too far, and opens fire on the Messenger, though it dodges out of the way. Adelei tries to banish it, and though the spell succeeds, the Messenger does enough to disrupt it - though it loses an arm in the process. Angered, it starts summoning Snow Wretches to aid it and causes snowstorms to blast the investigators, which knocks McG over. Adelei tries to banish it again, but finds that the spell fails. With everyone else attacking and injuring it, the Messenger starts to retreat and summon more Snow Wretches - but Peter finishes it off after Adelei blinds it. The team then make short work of the Snow Wretches.</p>
<p>Adelei picks up the black idol, which is still glowing with some strange power. This triggers the cave to collapse - the investigators run for the exit with frozen stalactites falling and the walls cracking. They burst free from the entrance just as the whole cave implodes. Taking some time to recover, they then head back to the car. As they drive back, they try to decide how to study the idol and whether it should be used or destroyed.</p>
