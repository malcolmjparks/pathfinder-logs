    <h1 id="hunger-from-below">Hunger from Below</h1>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-plan">So, What's the Plan?</h2>
<p>With the investigators fully prepped and ready for action, they drive to Arkham woods and set off to find the site of the ritual. Daisy has learned a new spell, and William and Joe have practiced their melee and ranged attack skills to fine art over the course of the day.</p>
<h2 id="before-the-finale">Before the Finale</h2>
<p>Creeping into the woods, the investigators find the bent oak tree and discover a clearing just beyond. They hear a chorus of howls, and are overwhelmed but nausea when the smell of rotting flesh washes over them. They spy a crowd of ghouls dragging dead bodies and other flesh over to a hole and dropping it in. After a hurried discussion, the use of a Molotov cocktail is decided to be the best way to both kill a large number of ghouls and create a distraction so they they can sneak by and investigate the hole. The plan is a success, and they follow the faint sound of chanting down some stairs into the darkness.</p>
<h2 id="the-ritual">The Ritual</h2>
<p>As they reach the bottom of the stairs, the chanting reaches an unhinged crescendo. They see three abductees tied up, while a cult leader wearing mask made of a huge elk skull leads other cultists in a ceremony. A hurried discussion takes place to decide strategy - Lita and William sneak forward and take cover behind a couple of pillars. Daisy emerges into the chamber and casts a spell targeting the cult leader. He offers a simple trade.</p>
<p>"Offer up the the betrayer of the Ancient One and you may leave this place unharmed - and you may take the other sacrifices with you."</p>
<p>Joe is initially torn between sacrificing Lita to the ritual and fighting back, but Daisy makes a good case to convince him to come in guns blazing - which he does, knocking the cult leader over. The other cultists rush forward to attack, but Lita and William hold them off for a while. As Daisy and the cult leader cast spells at each other, tentacles emerge from the depths and start attacking - first spraying William with acid, and then grabbing him and Lita. Daisy and Joe manage to injure the cult leader so much that he falls into a coma, while Agnes quickly tries to free the abductees.</p>
<p>Half the cultists are defeated, and Lita and William manage to break free of the tentacles just as the cult leader dies - triggering the chamber to start collapsing. Joe carries one abductee up the stairs, while Agnes convinces the others to run for their lives. Bursting free as the ground behind them collapses into itself, the investigators breathe a sigh of relief and take a moment to go over the events of the past day or so.</p>
<p>They have foiled the cultists' plans, but have they made themselves a target for Umh√¥rdhoth?</p>
