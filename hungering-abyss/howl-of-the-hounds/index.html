    <h1 id="the-howl-of-the-hounds">The Howl of the Hounds</h1>
<h2 id="lets-get-our-story-straight">Let's Get Our Story Straight</h2>
<p>The investigators meet up at Joe Diamond's house to talk about what they know and figure out where their first lead is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rita Young and Daisy Walker translate a strange coded message that refers to an "eternal one" and is signed by <strong>Peter Warren</strong>. Daisy knows where he lives. Rita laments the lack of coffee at Joe's house.</li>
<li>William Yorick finds a common theme in the inaccurate documentation from the morgue at St. Mary's Hospital, as they are signed by <strong>Ruth Turner</strong>. He also hides in various bathrooms, perhaps because he is nervous?</li>
<li>Joe Diamond suspects there is a cover-up by the police, and a stack of disappearance reports are signed by <strong>Billy Cooper</strong>. He also receives a phone call from Carolyn Fern, who is concerned that her friend <strong>Loretta Clark</strong> has been feeling anxious working the graveyard shift at the hospital.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="were-not-alone">We're Not Alone</h2>
<p>A crash comes from the cellar. The investigators move into the kitchen, and see that there is a strange mist behind the windows, blocking the view from outside. At this point, four ghouls rush up the stairs and attack! Joe shoots one with his trusty Colt 1911 pistols, Rita bashes one with a baseball bat, and William manages to knock one down the stairs with his shovel. Daisy desperately tries to undo the magic that is preventing them from leaving - but before she can manage, two more ghouls rush down from upstairs. With the aid of Daisy's shriveling spell, the ghouls are finished off, and Daisy has time to undo the magic.</p>
<p>The team step outside, only to face two more ghouls and a cackling ghoul priest. Joe and Daisy take up positions where they can shoot and cast spells remotely, while Rita and William go in swinging. After a pitched battle where Rita gets slightly wounded and Daisy is struck by horror, the ghouls are killed and the priest is defeated. He shrivels into a puddle of black goop, leaving behind a mysterious amulet.</p>
<h2 id="friend-or-foe">Friend or Foe?</h2>
<p>At this moment, <strong>Lita Chantler</strong> approaches, and tells the investigators more about the ghouls and that they are planning something for tomorrow night. She suggests burning down Joe's house, but Joe refuses. She plans to stop the ghouls' plan - and asks for help. The team decide they don't trust her and refuse, instead heading to Velma's diner to consult with <strong>Agnes Baker</strong> - a trusted friend of Joe.</p>
<p>Agnes tells the investigators that will need to know three things to have a chance of stopping the cult:</p>
<ul>
<li>The location of the ritual</li>
<li>Information of the ghouls' weaknesses</li>
<li>Details of the ritual in order to disrupt it</li>
</ul>
