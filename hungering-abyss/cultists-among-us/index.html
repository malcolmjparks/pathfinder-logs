<h2 id="the-police-station">The Police Station</h2>
<p>At the police station, Rita sneaks up near a couple of officers and overhears that Billy Cooper is at the graveyard. Taking Joe's car, the investigators drive there and through the fog they see a group of 5 ghouls digging away at some graves. Near them, Billy is leaning against a gravestone taking notes in a small book.</p>
<p>Rita sneaks up near Billy, and at that moment two things happen: Joe shoots a shotgun at Billy Cooper, catching him in one arm and disabling it, and William Yorick throws a Molotov Cocktail at the ghouls, setting them all on fire. With half the ghouls falling down from this attack, Daisy helps to finish them off with some more casts of Shrivelling. Rita goes on the offensive with her new baseball bat. She picks up a minor wound as Billy shoots back, but otherwise escapes with no injury as Billy is knocked to the ground disabled. Reading the notebook, the investigators find out the <strong>ghoul's weakness</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="st-marys-hospital">St. Mary's Hospital</h2>
<p>Heading to the hospital, Loretta Clark is on duty. Having said that they come at the request of Carolyn Fern, Loretta asks them to investigate one of the corridors that she has heard disturbances in. Rita picks up a first-aid kit and notices deep claw marks gouged into the floor and a blood-stained shirt sleeve. Loretta is convinced to give up her key for the team to investigate further. They go downstairs and meet the guard on his patrol, but as he introduces himself a ghoul bursts out of a nearby room and rips his throat out, while another drops from a vent in the ceiling. The investigators then finish these ghouls off, but another two ghouls and an especially large and fierce ghoul them burst out from the morgue and attack. Rita takes a large number of wounds, but in the meantime the large ghoul is severely injured and incapacitated by the other investigators. Rita manages to patch herself up with the first-aid kit, and the team finish off the remaining ghouls.</p>
<p>Investigating the morgue and Ruth Turner's desk, they find some notes she made describing how trepidatious she was feeling at the prospect of becoming a ghoul, and desricbes <strong>the site of the ritual</strong> in the woods.</p></div>
