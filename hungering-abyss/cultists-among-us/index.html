    <h1 id="cultists-among-us">Cultists Among Us</h1>
<h2 id="the-police-station">The Police Station</h2>
<p>At the police station, Rita sneaks up near a couple of officers and overhears that Billy Cooper is at the graveyard. Taking Joe's car, the investigators drive there and through the fog they see a group of 5 ghouls digging away at some graves. Near them, Billy is leaning against a gravestone taking notes in a small book.</p>
<p>Rita sneaks up near Billy, and at that moment two things happen: Joe shoots a shotgun at Billy Cooper, catching him in one arm and disabling it, and William Yorick throws a Molotov Cocktail at the ghouls, setting them all on fire. With half the ghouls falling down from this attack, Daisy helps to finish them off with some more casts of Shriveling. Rita goes on the offensive with her new baseball bat. She picks up a minor wound as Billy shoots back, but otherwise escapes with no injury as Billy is knocked to the ground, disabled. Reading the notebook, the investigators find out the <strong>ghouls' weaknesses</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="st-marys-hospital">St. Mary's Hospital</h2>
<p>Heading to the hospital, Loretta Clark is on duty. Having said that they come at the request of Carolyn Fern, Loretta asks them to investigate one of the corridors that she has heard disturbances in. Rita picks up a first-aid kit and notices deep claw marks gouged into the floor and a blood-stained shirt sleeve. Loretta is convinced to give up her key for the team to investigate further. </p>
<p>They go downstairs and meet the guard on his patrol, but as he introduces himself a ghoul bursts out of a nearby room and rips his throat out, while another drops from a vent in the ceiling. The investigators then finish these ghouls off, but another two ghouls and an especially large and fierce ghoul them burst out from the morgue and attack. Rita takes a large number of wounds, but in the meantime the large ghoul is severely injured and incapacitated by the other investigators. Rita manages to patch herself up with the first-aid kit, and the team finish off the remaining ghouls.</p>
<p>Investigating the morgue and Ruth Turner's desk, they find some notes she made describing how trepidatious she was feeling at the prospect of becoming a ghoul, and describes <strong>the site of the ritual</strong> in the woods.</p>
<h2 id="ambush-from-the-skies">Ambush from the Skies</h2>
<p>Rita has had enough and takes a break to head back home and rest up. Heading to the river docs to meet Joey "The Rat" Virgil, the rest of the investigators are shocked when the dead body of a man suddenly falls from the sky and smashes into a car in front of them. Two nightgaunts start to close in. Joe shoots one with his shotgun, and Daisy manages to case Shriveling on the other before one casts a spell that envelops everyone in thick smoke. One of the nightgaunts snatches William and carries him up into the skiy, but William manages to whack it with his spade - but at the expense of his leg which cracks when he is dropped to the ground. Meanwhile, Daisy goes in for an attack up close, but is also damaged in the leg when the nightgaunt stabs it with its tail.</p>
<p>Eventually, the nightgaunts are defeated, and Joe pools everyone's money together to purchase a Tommy Gun from Joey, which he equips (passing the shotgun on to William to use). A quick side-trip to Ye Olde Magick Shoppe means that Daisy also pick up an Elder Sign talisman.</p>
<h2 id="the-professors-house">The Professor's House</h2>
<p>Peter Warren's house is empty when the investigators get there. They discuss how best to break the door down when Lita Chantler turns up again and confidently picks the lock. Joe makes himself at home and starts making a sandwich in the kitchen, while William retreats to the toilet again. After looking around for a while, the investigators hear footsteps coming up the path and ready themselves.</p>
<p>Peter Warren enters the house with a couple of cultists and seems confident in overcoming any opposition. He seems likely to succeed when William shoots into the ceiling and he dodges Joe's bullets, however he falls to Daisy's shriveling spell and Lita shooting him with her pistol. Once he is out of the picture, the cultists fall soon after, and the team find a note with <strong>details of the ritual</strong>.</p>
