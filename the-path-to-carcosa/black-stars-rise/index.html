<h2 id="the-tide-rises">The Tide Rises</h2>
<p>With a storm raging, the investigators dock at Porte de l'Avonc√©e and make their way up the hill. The road to the abbey looks blocked, so the team make their way round the outer wall to the north tower. With the rain making the going treacherous, William and Joe slip and hurt themselves just before a monster appears over the ramparts. However, Rita manages to pick the beast up after it was injured and throws it over the wall to land on the rocks far below.</p>
<p>Gingerly making their way over some broken steps, a couple of cultists ambush the team, but again are defeated easily by the team. However when they approach the entrance to the abbey, a couple of Rift Seekers attack, which are a bit hardier. Rita breaks the wing of one and throws it at the other, and then Joe is shaken by the experience, but still manages to kill the second with his Tommy Gun.</p>
<h2 id="let-the-storm-rage">Let the Storm Rage</h2>
<p>Inside the abbey, the team are confronted by the Beast from Aldeberan - a tough fight in which Rita is injured, and Joe and William both are stricken with horror and have to run away before recovering. Once defeated, the investigators explore the abbey and find a lone monk who ushers them into a small room to wait for the abbot. As he disappears, the investigators search the room and find a key.</p>
<p>After the monk does not reappear, the team head to the tower and unlock it. At the top, they find a group of four cultists performing a ritual to summon Hastur - Rita throws one over the side of the tower, and William and Joe shoot the others.</p>
<h2 id="open-the-path-below">Open the Path Below</h2>
<p>Rushing back down to the abbey, they see the monk again who has no recollection of seeing them before. Leaving him behind, the investigators head to the chapel of St. Aubert. William sees the image of Carcosa below the waves, and tries to steel himself to dive in to the water. He doesn't manage, but Joe and Rita take the plunge, dragging him along with them.</p>
<p>The team emerge from the waters of Lake Hali and see the ruins of Carcosa in front of them.</p></div>
