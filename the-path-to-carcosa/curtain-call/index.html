<h2 id="awakening">Awakening</h2>
<p>The investigators watch the first act of <em>The King in Yellow</em> and are confused by the meandering and slow-paced story. Falling asleep in the interval, they are surprised when they wake to find the rest of the audience dead and the decor is ripped, rotten and tattered.</p>
<p>Not finding much in the auditorium itself, Joe leads the way to the foyer where they find the doors to the theatre seem to have been replaced with blank walls. Joe goes into the lighting booth and starts switching on lights - and sees movement in the shadows when he does. William and Daisy head up to the balcony, where William is pushed off into the auditorium below by a cultist in yellow robes. Another cultist appears in the auditorium at this point, and another in the doorway of the lighting booth. Daisy and Will deal with the two in the auditorium, and Joe expertly uses his dual-wielded pistols to take down the one in the booth.</p>
<p>Stepping up on to the stage, a large tentacled monster appears, but the investigators appear to finish it off before it can cause too much harm - at least it vanishes into the shadows. Exploring backstage, they hear a banging and cries for help from one of the rooms. <strong>Lola Hayes</strong> who played Cassilda in the play is trapped inside, telling the investigators that the actor who plays <strong>The Stranger</strong> (played by <strong>The Man in the Pallid Mask</strong>) changes for every performance, and sometimes between rehearsals. She tells them that he never takes his mask off, and that when he stared at her during the interval she blacked out - awaking to find herself locked in the dressing room which has become rotted and terrifying. Daisy finds a tattered yellow robe in the room, and decides to put it on. Looking out the door, she notices a shadow moving along the corridor.</p>
<h2 id="the-stranger">The Stranger</h2>
<p>The investigators and Lola rush along the corridor and see a shadow move into the rehearsal room (which has a strange symbol carved into the wall). Daisy confronts the Man in the Pallid Mask there, who gives the impression of laughing behind the mask. He is backed into the corner of the room, but at that moment, there is a crash and a wave of searing heat. The investigators turn to see that the auditorium is on fire - but when they turn back, the man is gone.</p>
<p>Rushing back towards the front of the theatre, the monster reappears, along with three cultists. The monster attacks William, who manages to hold it off while Daisy manages to incapacitate it. Meanwhile, Lola is engages with one cultist and Joe tries to escape but is cornered by the other two while the fire begins to surround him. Joe manages to expertly yank the two cultists into the fire and escape himself, while Lola blinds the monster and the remaining cultist in order to reach the foyer at the same time.</p>
<p>Standing by the wall where the doors to the outside used to be, The Man in the Pallid Mask watches the investigators approach. Joe opens fire on him and seems to hurt him. His disturbing visage and mannerisms quickly cause horror and panic among the team, and with the fire rapidly catching up to them things are looking grim. However Joe manages another one-two shot which hits the mask - which disturbingly does not drop away or appear damaged. At this moment, the man bows and opens a glass door leading outside, disappearing through it. With the theatre about to collapse, the investigators rush through and flee for a couple of blocks.</p>
<h2 id="encore">Encore</h2>
<p>Deciding not to go to the police, the team backtrack to see what has happened to the theatre. They are confused to see it standing with its exterior looking the same as it did before the play started. Daisy feels like she is being watched, and turning round she sees the man in the pallid mask standing on the sidewalk. He turns and disappears into the alley behind the theatre. Giving chase, the team find nothing except a poster invitation to the cast party, at the home of <strong>Constance Dumaine</strong>.</p></div>
