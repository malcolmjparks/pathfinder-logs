    <h1 id="a-phantom-of-truth">A Phantom of Truth</h1>
<h2 id="the-first-night">The first night</h2>
<p>After a restless night and dreams of the events so far, the investigators resolve to travel to Paris to try to find <strong>Nigel Engram</strong>, the mysterious producer of the play. Arriving at the Gare D'Orsay the team head towards Montparnasse where they remembered a a cast member saying that they had met Nigel there in a cafe. Heading that way, they hear discordant organ music coming from the Church of St. Barnabé.</p>
<p>At a bar in the evening, they don't manage to gather any information about Nigel, but they do encounter people talking about strange symbols that have been drawn on nearby buildings, which look uncannily like the <strong>Yellow Sign</strong> that that have encountered elsewhere, including on the onyx amulet that they "borrowed" from the historical society in Arkham. Heading to the Gardens of Luxembourg they find a statue holding the symbol, and footprints heading toward Notre Dame - however they are being watched by creatures above them. At this moment, the organ music they heard earlier starts echoing inside their head, and a mysterious figure with deathly pale skin dressed all in black approaches them. They manage to find a passage that is not watched and make a run for it. At Notre Dame they search around but don't find anything of significance.</p>
<p>The organ music echoes inside their head, and the mysterious figure approaches again. Wisely deciding to retreat, the team head to La Marais and then on to Père Lachaise Cemetery, where they are ambushed by a trio of Byakhees. After killing them, the figure accompanied by the mysterious piping appears again, but the team manage to evade him and at that moment dawn breaks, giving some respite. A gravestone gives a hint that the Engram family may be found in the west of the city.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-night">The second night</h2>
<p>Having some time to patch up some wounds, the team then head to the Canal Saint-Martin where they find an old plaque that references some hidden Catacombs under Paris. Joe finds a hidden passage which enables them to evade the organist again. Making a beeline for Montmartre, they find a late night cafe. With a bit of prompting, a member of the clientele has heard of Nigel Engram and says he has connections to the Grand Guignol theatre.</p>
<p>At the theatre, they catch the end of a play on the topic of insanity. After the show, the cast and audience are happy to discuss the issues raised, and happen to mention that Nigel has a house by the Opera Garnier. However, at this moment <strong>The Stranger</strong> appears. William manages to talk to him (though he does not respond), and which moment the investigators are startled by a noise behind them - the cast and audience are gone, and three cultists have appeared, and the Stranger has disappeared. A fight ensues, and the cultists are defeated, with two of the three dying from Daisy's spells. Dawn breaks and the team has a brief rest, though the sound of organ music never fully leaves them.</p>
<h2 id="the-third-night">The third night</h2>
<p>Heading to the Opera Garnier, the investigators are disturbed to see the doors open, a fine mist covering the ground, and most disturbingly a trail of blood leading up the steps. Deciding to make a final stand here, they decide to set traps. Rita has a moment of inspiration and decides to try playing the opera house's pipe organ, which she is relieved to discover seems to counteract some of the stress of the discordant organ music ringing in her head.</p>
<p>When the organist enters, the plan is put into action. An antique lamp on a rope swing down and hits him, and then William swings down and stabs him. These actions seem to baffle him rather than damage him, but they do slow him down. He does seem rather more disconcerted by the organ music that Rita is playing. When William tries to put a straitjacket on him, he is indifferent - causing the jacket to decay into pieces and striding forward. He seems to only be slowed by music, so Joe And Daisy start singing - which is initially successful, but the organist quickly adapts so that it no longer affects him. Instead, they rush to the orchestra pit to try to find musical instruments to aid with Rita's work on the organ. They find a violin and a saxophone left behind and start to play along.</p>
<p>At this point, William is terrified, and tries to run away - forgetting that he is tied to a rope. He does manage to cut himself free and escapes to the corner of the opera house, where he pulls out a harmonica. With the music playing, the organist is slowed enough that he barely reaches Rita before dawn breaks, and fails to destroy the minds of the investigators. At dawn, he disappears into mist, and the team make a break for it. By chance, they find Nigel Engram's house as they are escaping. They knock on the door.</p>
<p>Nigel welcomes them into his house, and gives them cheese and biscuits. He also seems to have been expecting them - and seems excited that the investigators will find the path to Carcosa. On his table is a map of the secret catacombs below Paris. He steps into the kitchen to fetch the tea - however when Daisy follows him, she finds his body hanging from the ceiling fan, rotting from weeks of decomposition.</p>
