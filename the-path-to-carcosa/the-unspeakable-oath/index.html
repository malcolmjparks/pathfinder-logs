    <h1 id="the-unspeakable-oath">The Unspeakable Oath</h1>
<h2 id="locked-inside">Locked Inside</h2>
<p>The investigators stop off at The Olde Curiosity Shoppe for Daisy to pick up an amulet of protection. Arriving at Arkham Asylum, they are welcomed by the receptionist who listens to their story about the King in Yellow and tells them that <strong>Daniel Chesterfield</strong> is in patient confinement and is only to be seen by medical staff under the direction of Dr. Mintz. Going in to the asylum, the doors are locked behind them and they turn to find that the receptionist has disappeared. </p>
<p>Going into a staff room, Daisy and Rita find some doctors' white coats and decide to put them on. Rita also picks up a mug of coffee. The other patients do not respond to questioning and avoid the team, until two of them with a yellow gleam in their eyes attack. The investigators defeat them, and then head towards the infirmary. There they find a nurse who is very upset that Daisy and Rita have stolen staff uniforms, and when Daisy tries to claim that they are members of staff, she asks security to come in, and they restrain Daisy in a straitjacket and ask her to calm down. Rita takes this opportunity to steal the keys from nurse's belt. After they leave the infirmary, Rita helps Daisy out of the straitjacket.</p>
<h2 id="tortuous-descent">Tortuous Descent</h2>
<p>Unlocking the basement door, the team head down into the patient confinement area, where they find six cells. One cell contains a fit-looking middle aged man pacing around with a rictus grin permanently on his face. Another cell contains a women muttering about the guards, but the team can't make much sense of it. Two other cells contain old patients lying down, and one cell Joe is shocked to discover is empty but has his own handwriting on the wall mapping the way out. The last cell contains Daniel. The team free him, and when he sees the onyx amulet that was recovered from the Historical Society, he rants about Nigel Engram making them speak the Oath. "We spoke His name and the price was paid! Hastur! Hastur! O King!"</p>
<p>Calming him down a little, the team think they might be able to get more information out of him if they leave the asylum, so they start to plot a way to escape. They are briefly delayed by a monster coming down the stairs, but kill it before it gets a chance to attack them.</p>
<h2 id="no-asylum">No Asylum</h2>
<p>After a brief realisation that all the investigators are starting to see the symbol from the onyx amulet (the <strong>Yellow Sign</strong>) everywhere, the team set loose the grinning man - who they convince to go to the infirmary to cause trouble. Rita rushes off to light a fire in the kitchen to cause a distraction, while Daisy, William, and Joe start a fight in the yard. Several possessed patients attack, and the investigators defeat them. Unlocking the gate to the garden, they are confronted with a strange beast emerging from the trees. Rita runs to the outside gate, but it is locked and none of the keys on the nurse's keyring fit. At this moment, she remembers that she had a lock-pick tucked away and recovers it from inside her jacket. With the others holding the beast off, she picks the lock on the gate and everyone flees with Daniel in tow.</p>
<h2 id="lost-soul">Lost Soul</h2>
<p>Over a couple of days, the investigators manage to calm Daniel down, and he tells them that the King in Yellow is not just a play - it is a being named <strong>Hastur</strong>. He warns them not to say his name, and that the cultists are trying to find Carcosa to release Hastur from his prison. He asks the investigators to find the path before them, and seal Hastur for good.</p>
<p>After coming back from a walk, the investigators find Daniel dead - choked to death. They decide to heed his warning, and start to work out how to get to Paris - where they believe Nigel Engram could be found.</p>
