<h2 id="fashionably-late">Fashionably Late</h2>
<p><strong>Constance Dumaine</strong> is hosting a party - but the investigators are met at the door by a path of blood, discordant music, and a doorman with only bloody stumps where he should have hands.</p>
<p>Exploring the courtyard, the team are attacked by two nightgaunts who where perching on the rooftops. After defeating them, the team go through to the dining room, where they are confronted by the smell of rancid and rotten food. They interview <strong>Sebastien Moreau</strong>, who tells them that he has produced this show in Paris, Florence, New York - and that this was not the first production of "The King in Yellow" to be performed in Arkham.</p>
<h2 id="the-terrifying-truth">The Terrifying Truth</h2>
<p>Sebastien's passionate response seems to change his body, as fur sprouts and bulbous growths appear and his muscles bulge. He attacks the investigators, who quickly subdue him.</p>
<p>Moving in to the ballroom so that Daisy can do a spot of dancing, <strong>Ashleigh Clarke</strong> is singing a song from the play about <strong>Lost Carcosa</strong> which mesmerizes the team. She follows this with a piercing shriek as her skin tightens hideously around her bones and insects start to eat there way out of her arms and shoulders. The investigators attack her and manage to overcome her.</p>
<p>In the foyer again, the team meet Constance, who is confused and insulted when Daisy accuses her of hosting monsters and killers. She relates how the director <strong>Nigel Engram</strong> made everyone swear some sort of Oath before the rehearsals started. She laughs as the skin begins to fall off her body. Once again, the team subdue her.</p>
<p>In the living room, they find the financier <strong>Jordan Perry</strong> sitting on the sofa smoking a cigar. The investigators manage to convince him to invest in Rita's education and he donates some money to the team. He ruminates on the fact that not every investment is about capital gain, and he was convinced by Nigel Engram to do the same for the play. As he puffs on his cigar, his body swells and his skin begins to harden and crack - with smoke issuing forth. The temperature in the room rises, and he attacks the investigators.</p>
<p>Once he is defeated, the costume designer <strong>Ishimaru Huruko</strong> enters the room. She tells the team about the time she saw the 'Stranger' drawing a symbol. She recreates it for the team, and as she finishes it, her spine grows and extends upwards separating her torso from the bottom half of her body. At this moment the Stranger also appears. The investigators defeat them both, and decide this is an opportune moment to leave the party.</p>
<h2 id="realitys-shadow">Reality's Shadow</h2>
<p>As the team leaves, they are surprised to see that the front yard is now clean, the windows not smashed, and the soothing tones of slow jazz drifting out from the courtyard. They decide that things have calmed down and that they should go back to investigate what happened. All signs of the struggles and oddities have vanished, but as they enter the dining room, they see the Stranger speaking with a tall mustached man holding a silver-handled cane. The team run from the house in a haze of pain and disorientation.</p>
<p>At this point, they feel they need to gear up, so they drive to the docks to meet with Jimmy "the Rat" and buy a Tommy gun and a sledgehammer.</p></div>
