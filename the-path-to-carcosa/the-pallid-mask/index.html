    <h1 id="the-pallid-mask">The Pallid Mask</h1>
<h2 id="through-the-catacombs">Through the Catacombs</h2>
<p>With the partial map of the secret catacombs under Paris in hand, the investigators grab some torches and lanterns and head for the entrance. Once in the catacombs, they see the Man in the Pallid Mask beckon them forward and then disappear into the shadows. The investigators try to follow. but find themselves in a labyrinth of winding tunnels and chambers, with chattering skulls lining the walls.</p>
<p>In an arched passageway, they are ambushed by ghouls - but these are quickly defeated. In another chamber, they find Dr. Thierry Henry (who Daisy recognises) who seems to be enchanted or possessed in some way and he is studying some carvings on the wall of one chamber.</p>
<p>The team are also attacked by a disfigured humanoid enemy, but again manage to defeat it without to many issues. Unfortunately William is hypnotised by the Well of Souls, and drops his bowie knife down into it. It falls a long, long way before he hears a noise of it striking the bottom. Daisy and Joe are getting disturbed by the thought of something following them.</p>
<p>Eventually the team find the Man in the Pallid Mask in the Tomb of Shadows, where he appears to be gesturing at the writing on the wall.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-is-barred">The Path is Barred</h2>
<p>The team decide to take the time to try to understand what he is doing, and the Man in the Pallid Mask takes something from the fire to help him cast shadows in particular ways upon the wall, revealing a strange diagram. The shadows combine into an image of a building with a tall tower. with the spire reaching up to the ceiling. He beckons for the investigators to follow, and then disappears through the archway back into the catacombs.</p>
<p>The Spectre of Death now catches up with the team, and starts to attack. The team manage to hold it off, and then Rita comes up with a plan to shove it down the Well of Souls - and succeeds! With the Spectre now out of the picture for now, the team hurry on.</p>
<h2 id="leading-the-way">Leading the Way</h2>
<p>In a bone-filled cavern, more ghouls are dispatched with ease, and Willian manages to find a hatchet that manages to adequately replace his knife. Crawling through a small tunnel (and pulling Daisy with them after she got stuck), the investigators find a dead-end. The Stranger holds the skull that he pulled from the fire aloft, and the floor collapses into a dark pit. The Stranger bows, and falls backwards into the pit. The investigators jump in after him.</p>
<p>Visions of two skylines, one above and one below, appear. One is of Mont Saint-Michel, and the other a warped reflection. This could be where the passageway between realities can be found. Waking up in the streets of Paris, the team decide to make their way to the coast to investigate.</p>
