    <h1 id="echoes-of-the-past">Echoes of the Past</h1>
<h2 id="race-for-answers">Race for Answers</h2>
<p>Tonight's performance of "The King in Yellow" was not the first Arkham had seen. Daisy Walker ducks out at Velma's Diner to try to get her hair cut, and the rest of the team travel to the Arkham Historical Society to try to find out more. They arrive to find the front doors cracked halfway open and light streaming out.</p>
<p>Opening the door to one of the record offices, they find numerous filing cabinets - all of which have been covered with a layer of thick black sludge. Deciding to leave this room alone, they move next to the meeting room. William finds an old lamp under the table, while Joe uses his investigative powers to deduce the hole in the ceiling was probably made by a sledgehammer. Rita denies that it was made by her, and has a relaxing cup of coffee while she watches the others do their stuff.</p>
<p>Moving through into a large museum room with exhibits about Arkham's past, they find an old knife that William decides is very useful - but at that moment they hear a whispering voice echo through the building and all the electrical lights shatter. Luckily William still has his kerosene lamp and leads the way - but everyone hears the sound of movement in the floor above.</p>
<p>Going upstairs, the team interrupt two cultists who are rummaging in the library. They are quickly dispatched, and a search of their bodies leads to Rita finding reference to a "secret" library somewhere.</p>
<p>In the reading room next to the library, they find a record pertaining to the "dreadful events" surrounding the closure of the Cedar Playhouse. A note attached to the record states that the matter is too ghastly for the public eye, and that the full records are found in the hidden library.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes-of-the-past">Mistakes of the Past</h2>
<p>The front door of the manor opens and then slams shut. The investigators hear a scared voice exclaiming that they don't know where the door is. Another voice responds with "You spoke the oath. You spoke his name." The first voice stammers "No! I cannot!" before his voice becomes distorted and cuts off. Wet footsteps start coming up the stairs.</p>
<p>Rita stands at the top of the stairs and hits the monster that appears with her sledgehammer, while Joe shoots it. William then stabs it and pushes it down the stairs. The monster shakes its head and appears to heal all damage and injuries to it, then starts climbing the stairs again. Again, it is shot, smashed and stabbed, and again it recovers.</p>
<p>At this point, William smashes his kerosene lamp against it forcing it back behind a wall of flame, where it appears to wait for the flames to die down. With a couple of minutes leeway, the investigators rush upstairs where they see light coming from one of the rooms. Rushing in they grab a couple of desks and quickly move them out to barricade the stairs, above the confused protestations of <strong>Mr. Peabody</strong>, the historical society curator. </p>
<h2 id="the-oath">The Oath</h2>
<p>Joe tries to spin him a tall tale about what is going on, but Mr. Peabody does not seem convinced until William tells him what they need - access to the hidden library. Mr. Peabody says that he did know of some record on secret passages in the building, but he would have to look at the record to find out for sure.</p>
<p>In the records room on the top floor, they find four more cultists rummaging for clues - Rita ambushes one, while Joe and William attack two more. Unfortunately, this fight does not go well for the team, with William and Rita picking up injuries from the fight and both running away scared at one point. Luckily Joe managed to finish off the last cultist, giving Mr. Peabody the time to search for the record he needed. He locates the secret latch that opens the way to the hidden library, and the team find the information they need - along with a mysterious onyx clasp with an alien inscription which the team decide to keep.</p>
<p>The last record about "The King in Yellow" they find relates to a stagehand <strong>Daniel Chesterfield</strong>, who lost his wits after the final show. He was admitted to the asylum after the production ended. Perhaps he's still there...</p>
