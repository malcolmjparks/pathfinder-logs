A vision of the dragon god of destruction Dahak manifests, and burns all the characters. Quan manages to find a way to divert the energy back at the manifestation to disable it. He'll be doing that a lot. Through the portal at the end of the passageway, they find themselves in the Mwangi jungle, and are approached by a large number of Ekujae elves, including Jahsi . He says they are being troubled by cinderclaw cultists, and they have destroyed a white dragon pillar that was being erected here. He takes you to their village (called Akrivel, home to the leopard clan) and introduces you to his half-elf daughter Nketia . A feast is arranged. Findir and Quan take part in a dancing game where you have to dance to a rhythm whilst trying to kick bells attached to your opponent's ankles. They succeed in the first match, but lose the second. Rab McNab goes hunting and impressively manages to find and kill a large waterbuck. He also tries to befriend the lioness that lives in the village and succeeds at the second attempt. The team are brought to the clan leaders and manage to impress them with tales of their exploits and demonstrations of skill. During the feast, there is a spicy pepper eating contest, which Quan fails at but Findir succeeds at. Quan and Vejonica manage to convince Jahsi to admit his love for his friend Akosa. Nketia tells a story: There was a time of great darkness The people stood against the darkness but could not damage it The most righteous gave their lives to forge their souls into weapons The people could not kill the darkness, but managed to force it back and trap it in the space between spaces The Ekujae are sworn to stand guard so the darkness could not escape again Nketia says that there are now places in the jungle they cannot go without being struck by blindness. She asks VQFR to investigate and try to stop what is going on. Pillars of Ruin The team head east. They find a black dragon pillar being guarded by two charau-kas who have been infused with draconic features, but manage to defeat them and disable the pillar. Heading south, they find a temple on the edge of a cliff, with an \"explorer\" Gerhard Pendergrast about to blow it up. They defuse the bombs and defeat him. They take the gunpowder barrels and put them in his bag of holding, which they take with them. Rab and Findir fight over who gets to keep his monacle. Heading south-west, the team find a green dragon pillar with a couple of jungle drakes, which they defeat. Further south-west, there is a blue pillar being dragged away by Erhard Pendergrast . The team kill him, and now they have two monocles, so Rab and Findir are happy. They also take his boat, which they can use to camp on and get about the jungle faster. Hearing a disturbance to the north, they find a man holding a large sack. After his unconvincing lies about what is in the sack, they fight him (he turns out to be an evil fey) and rescue the earthbound angel inside. Heading east along the river, they find the cinderclaw main base. Fighting a giant deinosuchus called Sweettooth involved Findir jumping on its back and stabbing it while everyone else tried to hit it from the boat. Eventually the team kill it, and Rab no doubt tries to skin it. I think they take some teeth as well. Realising that there is a barrier stopping them getting in to the base, they work out that destroying the dragon pillars will lower the barrier. They head up the river and destroy two more dragon pillars (orange and red) and then find a giant mine. Blood for Gold VQFR scout the area and as well as the mine pit, they see some charau-kas next to a firepit, some sick boggards on some camp beds, a giant pile of dirt and a cage. Sneaking round the north of the mine pit, they defeat a vrock, and reach the cage which has a mokele-mbembe in it. Climbing up the giant pile of dirt, they are attacked by spiders. This raises the alarm, and once the spiders are defeated, the team is attacked by the cinderclaws and their leader, a kobold alchemist. Once defeated, the team see a group of cinderclaws guarding the dragon pillar in the centre of the mine pit. Rab and Findir come up with a plan where they drop a barrel of gunpowder down to try to blow them up, which works very well. The remainder panic and start running up the slope, but Vejonica rolls the last barrel of gunpowder down the ramp and Rab shoots it with a flaming arrow. The team then mop up the remaining cinderclaws here and Quan disables the violet dragon pillar. Legacy of Ash and Bone Heading back to the cinderclaw HQ, the team break in through the front doors and fight a couple of clay golems, which turn out to be tricky to damage. The HQ itself appears to be made from the bones of a giant dragon. Fighting through the cinderclaws, they make it to the doors of the sanctum, which is protected by a very nasty magical trap. This would have killed Quan except for his cat's luck! In the room outside the ritual chamber, they find carvings of prayers to Dahak. In the ritual chamber itself, they find an immense skull of a dragon with gold pouring from its mouth, which shoots fire at non-cinderclaws from its eyes. A raised stone slab has a young red dragon called Kyrion is chained there, and the cinderclaw leader Belmazog stands over him. Quan goes to disable to dragon skull by removing the magical ruby eyes. Findir unlocks Kyrion while Rab keeps Belmazog busy, and Vejonica tried to keep everyone healed. Eventually they succeed in killing her with Kyrion's help, and he is very grateful. There is a mysterious gold shard sticking through his chest. He promises to visit VQFR in Breachill soon. Heading back to the village, the team meet back up with Nketia, who rewards them and gives them another magical artifact - the magical starknife Eclipse, which is a key to the Dreamgate portal. Heading back through the portal, the team get back to Hellknight Hill and arrange for more repairs to the castle, including a training room and fixing the walls.","title":"Cult of Cinders"},{"location":"age-of-ashes/cult-of-cinders/#cult-of-cinders","text":"","title":"Cult of Cinders"},{"location":"age-of-ashes/cult-of-cinders/#children-of-the-godslayers","text":"Going through the portal, they find a passageway that looks like it was made of hardened lava.

She seems to have memory problems. Luckily, Findir insults her and she flies into a rage, incapacitating several of the team with a shriek of crushing despair. In between sobs, the team manage to defeat her before approaching the crystals, which lash out with energy also causing despair. The team manage to disable the crystals though and Baba picks up some interesting books. Going through the other gate of the waystation, the team find themselves in a cave with more crystals and some strange tunnels. Two of the crystals have formed sentent ooze-like creatures, which attack. The team fight back, but the oozes keep splitting in half. At one point, Vejonica is engulfed by one of the oozes which starts to turn her into a crystal ooze too. She panics and casts a level 6 sound burst to try to break free, which almost kills the ooze but not quite. Baba comes to her rescue and saves her while the others finish the other oozes off. Travelling through the tunnel, a cave worm suddenly attacks. Findir thinks this is the ideal time to get swallowed, and Quan thinks this is such a great idea that he will try too. They both take damage while being swallowed. The cave worm also thinks this is a good idea, as it can regurgitate them and fire them out - Findir gets fired at Rab, who manages to duck out the way, while Quan gets fired at Vejonica who is not so lucky. Rab and Baba meanwhile have been doing a bunch of damage to the worm (and Baba manages to intimidate it somehow), and Vejonica finishes it off with a well-placed fireball. Going further along the passage leads to a large wall with a crack in it just large enough to squeeze through. Rab sends his warg animal companion warg through the crack to scope out the scene, and he sees two gugs cheering on a giant bat who is tearing into some ghoul bodies. The team try to sneak in through the crack, but the gugs spot them and come in to attack with great ferocity. Vejonica heals herself after taking considerable damage, and Baba takes this opportunity to do a wall run, jumping on to the giant bat and choking it until it falls unconscious. Rab then manacles it. With one of the gugs falling under repeated attacks, the other gug runs for help, opening the door at the for side of the chamber and running down the hall. A cloud of fungus spores are thrown up in its wake as it reaches three more gugs who were lounging in the next chamber. Findir gives chase, also throwing up spores which choke Baba, and Vejonica stars casting fireballs left, right and centre. Rab fires some arrows from afar, then goes back to perform a coup de grace on the giant bat. Baba clears some of the fungus out the way, but Quan decides to follow Findir's course and also runs through the fungus, choking more of the team with spores. Taking out two more gugs, the last gug pounds on the door asking for help. The chief gug comes bursting in and growling in a language that nobody in the team understands. He doesn't last long, with some heavy blows raining down on him and a finisher with some panache from Findir. With the gugs all dead, the team spend some time to clear out the fungus, recover and heal. After a while, they explore a bit more and find a trapped ghast named Deadmouth , who tells them they are in the ancient city city of Saggorak . After freeing him, he relates that the city was once a great Dwarven kingdom, but was besieged by an orc army centuries ago and the dwarves fell - with a lot of them turning into undead (ghouls, ghasts, ghosts and other unsavoury types) which ironically wiped out the orc army. However, later (but still a long time ago), a small portion of the city was taken back by the dwarves and is now known as Kovlar . He recommends that the team seek shelter there, or face the wrath of the \"Molten King\" of Saggorak, a dragon called Veshumirix . At this point, he tries to make a break for it, but Baba kills him with a single blow. Emerging into the city, the team are hailed by a dwarven scout called Parjil Longbraid , who says she was observing the gugs and trying to work out what to do about them. She is alarmed at the mention of draconic activity, and guides the team on the hour-long trek to Kovlar, the only light in the city other than the glow of Rab's halo. On the way, the team see the devastation of Saggorak, but also learn that Kovlar is known for high-quality armour and weapons. However, the two elves in the team may find themselves in hot water if they do not control their obvious disdain for dwarves! Welcome to Kovlar The party are presented to the Court of Regents in Kovlar. The current speaker and leader of the Guild of Anvillers - Kelda Halrig - welcomes them to Kovlar, and thanks them for dealing with the gugs. They court asks why they are here, and how they got in to Saggorak, and Rab explains - though with some interruption from Findir who insists that they really just want treasure. Each of the ten regents of the guild then ask each member of the team a question, which they can answer directly or by demonstrating something that they think will impress that regent. Seven of the ten are impressed enough that they accept that the team will be able to help Kovlar, and gift some items to help with the jobs that they will give out. Guild Regent Trusts the team?

He teaches Findir a lighting bolt spell Physic Guild Highphysic Natri Dolgindir No initially, now yes None Stonemason's Guild Mountainheart Kolarun Chiselrock No None Confronted with evidence of his plots and arrested Deep Terror Taking on a job for the Guild of Arms, the team investigate the Bluecrab lake, where Vejonica determines that the crabs are being poisoned. Rab expertly pilots the boat towards the spawning grounds, and luckily sees a couple of gigantic lake serpents approaching. Findir teleports on to the back of one, which promptly swallows him. The other capsizes the boat and swallows Vejonica. Findir cuts his way free from the inside of the lake serpent, which by this time has targeted a flying Rab McNab, infecting him with a hallucinogenic fungus which causes him to fire arrows at random targets. Vejonica bursts free from the belly of the second serpent, twice her normal size, glowing with fire and holding a flaming scimitar. She gets shot at by Rab. Baba pummels one of serpents, and is also shot at by Rab. Findir hides under the capsized boat. Eventually the serpents are defeated and the team head back to shore to patch themselves up and report their findings. Theft from the Vaults The inevitable guard claims Fortunate Algera Kord took the missing runestone. The logs of borrowing for the relevant night are missing. Only regents can enter the vault. The team go to the casino to confront Fortunate Algera Kord, who gives the team her alibi, and also tells them in confidence that her house was broken in to. Rab is at one of the tables of the casino, cigar in his mouth and playing poker. Investigating Algera's house, Quan notices that her lockbox has been picked, and Findir notices human footprints outside, leading north. A Curious Expedition Archmage Hromgar Nalruven wished to see the elf-gate. On the way there, the party get a little lost and are ambushed by a gogiteth, that they eventually defeat. Hromgar remains in Breachill for a while, learning about the area. He teaches Findir a lighting bolt spell as thanks for escorting him and showing him the gate. Shady Dealings To settle a dispute between the Anvillers' Guild and some merchants, the team inspect a selection of goods. Baba manages to spot a common design amongst flawed goods. The team bring a selection of smiths along and ask them to pick out their best work - a dwarf smith called Brigven picks out one of the flawed weapons, and when confronted by this, he dithers until Baba intimidates him into spilling the beans. He claims agents of Droskar blackmailed him, and they are also working to bring down the city. Missing Persons A missing dwarf called Algret left a note that seems unlikely to be written by her given her personality. The party notice that is is a forgery, and ask around town for information. Some people noticed her heading north at some point before disappearing. Two dwarf guards are spotted following the party, and when confronted they claim they are investigating the team and they are suspicious of their activities. Questioning Commander Grokar Hammersong leads them to think these guards may be rogue, as there are no orders for guards to follow the party. Chiselrock's Prison The team evade the guards following them and follow them back to their base. Other guards come out and head off into the city. Baba goes to fetch help, and Quan picks the lock to go in. Quan, Findir and Vejonica rush in and take the remaining guards by surprise - but it's a close battle, with Quan reduced to 1 hit point. Eventually the guards are defeated, and the team investigate the building. They find lots of evidence of Chiselrock paying people off, undermining other members of the guild and general no-good. They also find Algret, who tells them she was a spy tasked with rooting out corruption and had been captured when she was investigating the building. Commander Grokar is very pleased to rescue her. Baba summons the other guild leaders, and confronts Chiselrock with the evidence. He blusters, but as he sees his plans fall apart he concedes defeat and is arrested and led away. Among the evidence gathered is confirmation that there is a hidden temple of Droskar in the city, which is forbidden.

VQFR go to meet him, and he proposes that they work together. He asks them to find three people that won't be missed, and will be excellent stock for the slave trade. VQFR refuse, and he retreats and sets off a trapped lathe. The team manage to disable the trap and attack and kill Heuberk and his cronies, and rescue the wainwright. Making their was through the Dreamgate, the team find themselves in a waystation, which was once dedicated to the goddess of dreams, Desna . It has now been desecrated in Abyssal. Heading into the north passageway, they find a statue of a tree, which grabs everyone except Vejonica (who didn't enter the room). Quan manages to disable it, but not before three visions are seen: A vision of fighting a giant ice devil on a hillside A vision of deafening bells A vision of drowning in a quarry The reason for the corruption becomes clear when the team see an Annis Hag and a Night Hag talking to a bone devil. When they realise they have been disturbed, the hags attack and the bone devil disappears. The team defeat the hags, and the bone devil appears to have gone to a different plane. Sneaking around the rest of the waystation, they see another night hag and a nightmare (fiery horse) which they decide to leave alone; the team go through the other portal. Finding themselves on the edge of a small town called Cypress Point in the country of Ravounel , they realise that the town is under attack and there is a large boat at the quay. Fighting a group of slavers and rescuing a prisoner, they find out that the attackers are slavers associated somehow with the Scarlet Triad , previously thought to be a respectable group of traders and merchants. VQFR first go and fight the slavers on the quay and on the boat, including a kalavakus demon. They free the prisoners, and head to the smokehouse where the leader of this attack is on the roof, directing. He knocks Rab down and kicks him unconscious several times while Quan and Findir deal with his pet flame drakes. Eventually they are all defeated and the team free the town leaders. They then make sure that no fires are being set in the boathouse and defeat a couple of krooths. With the town saved, they talk to a diplomat called Halleka Shadeborn from neighbouring Nidal , who wants to accompany them on their journey to the capital Kintargo . They decide to take the boat along the coast. Shadows on the Silver City Once they reach Kintargo, they are directed to dock at the pier of Sunset Imports . Rather than sneak in, they decide to break down the doors - there is a fight between the team and some bruisers and another kalavakus demon. Vejonica entirely fails to push piles of crates over. Once defeated, you free a halfling called Hundy Vosht who tells them that he was tortured and revealed the location of the members and allies of the Bellweather Network , a secret society dedicated to abolishing slavery. They also are disturbed by Sedranni Vashnarstill who tells the team that she is the owner of Sunset Imports, and that she allied with the Scarlet Triad without knowing who they really were. They had taken over her building and she is very grateful to the team for dealing with them. Heading to Kite Hill, the team meet Nolly Peltry , a halfling and leader of the Bellflower Network. She gives kites to the team for them to send coded messages and Findir does an exceptionally good job. However, at that moment a giant ice demon appears and attacks the locals, shouting \"For the Umbral Lord!\" and other praises of Nidal. The team defeat it (with Findir on its back again) and another halfling tells you that a wizard summoned the ice devil and he didn't look Nidalese. The team agrees to prevent rumours of a Nidalese attack. Rab tracks the wizard back towards town but loses the trail when they get to the stone road. Heading to the Long Roads Coffeehouse, you find it has already been attacked. The team overcomes a bunch of spirits, and then find and defeat a couple of shapeshifting rakshasas. They rescue a halfling who tells them that a group of workers had been taken to Tanessen Tower . Rab takes a big bag of coffee with him. At Lady Docur's school for girls, Findir makes a big mess of trying to charm Lady Docur. They find out that the school is actually secretly training girls in combat and is allied with the Bellflower Network. Because of this, the attackers were captured. The team agree that Lady Docur will discreetly dispose of the prisoners. Heading to the tower, Findir interrupts some poisoners who are making jokes on the podium, and a fight ensues. On the next level, a fight with two alchemical golems leads to a lot of exploding capsules. After defeating some more poisoners and thugs, the team finally face the wizard Barushak along with his summoned velstracts. The team easily defeat him by plenty of use of the \"Brexit Tackle\" and take his notes, written in Infernal. Rescuing Laria Longroad , she tells you that other slaves have already been taken to Summershade Quarry , and she promises that the team will have free coffee for life. The Cornered Quarry VQFR drop by Lady Docur's school for girls again and manage to meet up with Findir's 3rd cousin 4 times removed - an elf monk called Baba Ganoush . Lady Docur wants him to accompany the team to help root out the slavers from the country. The team head south for a couple of days until they get to a small town, where the mayor / landowner admits that the quarry was abandoned partly because the workers found a strange cave that they believe to be haunted. Upon reaching the quarry, Quan and Rab check the guards, and find out that they have been dead for a while and have been posed to look like nothing is wrong. The team head into a lookout cave, where they surprise a bunch of thugs who were gambling when they should have been on lookout. The team kill these guards, but then another set of guards finds them. Baba is practicing his grappling quite a lot, and one of the guards ends up slowed, clumsy and confused. Once the toughest guard goes down, the others surrender. Leaving the remaining guards tied up, the team then progress through a tunnel in the side of the quarry until they reach a sleeping chamber with beds big enough for giants - and there are indeed four giants there. A fight ensues, and the giants fight fanatically to the death. Round the corner, they find a set of four large ghastly bears who look like they are guarding the entrance to another chamber. The team take them by surprise and quickly overwhelm the bears. Due to some comically low perception checks, the lich and his two giant assistants do not notice the fight and are also taken by surprise. The fight is quickly over as Baba, Vejonica and Quan overwhelm the lich and destroy his current body before he can react, and Findir and Rab manage to take out the two remaining giants. With this area now clear, Rab and Baba prise some emeralds out of some wall carvings while Vejonica heals everyone. The team continue round the quarry and find a chamber with some poisoners and an alchemical golem. Rab takes the opportunity to practice his bowmanship and lets off a few volleys. Baba and Quan both Brexit tackle a poisoner each, and Findir goes and attacks the golem, for which he gets an electricity bomb going off in his face. Rather miffed by this, he then Brexit tackles Baba for some reason. Vejonica has to intervene with a spell to make everyone think Baba is fatally wounded to calm things down. Once these enemies are defeated, the team go through to a luxuriously decorated room where a man lounges on a couch smoking a pipe and pondering a game board. He invites the team to take a look, and then surprises them by flipping the board over which releases a couple of greater shadows, while he transforms into a fiend in the shape of a gorilla. With things looking a bit perilous, Vejonica casts Celestial Accord, and the fiend critically fails his will save and hence becomes friendly to the team for 1 minute. Vejonica convinces him to join in with the fight against the greater shadows, which now becomes a cake-walk. Once defeated, Rab then convinces the fiend to take a drink of a refreshing tonic - which does quite a lot of damage to him - and everyone takes a shot at him to finish him off, a la Julius Caeser. Having a look around the room, the team \"salvage\" four bottles of fine wine, plus another bottle of less-than-fine wine, a bottle a sake, and some fancy rugs among other things. In the next chamber, they find the (currently empty) nest of Laslunn , a knoll and leader of the Scarlet Triad in Kintargo, who Vejonica recognises as being from Katapesh from the trappings around the nest. Laslunn is waiting by some mechanism when the team enter, and chuckles as she pulls a lever, which opens some sluices and causes gallons of water to flow across the chamber and down some tubes into the quarry. She taunts \"You've come all this way to rescue my slaves, but now they will all drown\" before firing a couple of arrows. Baba bravely fights the giant cyborg velstrac that is guarding the chamber, before getting wounded and starting to die. Rab grows his wings and starts throwing alchemist's fire from near the ceiling. Vejonica recognises it as a fiend, and casts some Divine Lances at it. Quan manages to flank it and do some sneak attacks. Findir rushes over to Laslunn and tries to distract her by doing the Macarena - failing at first, but then dazzling her for several rounds. After being revived by Vejonina (twice), Baba manages to knock the velstrac over and the team finish it off. Rab is desperately trying to close the sluices to slow the flow of water. At this point, Vejonica grabs some keys from Rab (that he found on the gorilla fiend) and slides down the tunnels like a flume to try to unlock the slaves and prevent them from drowning. Everyone else gangs up on Laslunn, until she decides to cut her losses, and she also escapes down the water slides - however Baba takes chase and finishes her off as she was about to escape. Rab takes some time to search the rest of the quarry and finds a large amount of liquor and the Eye of the Wise - which has markings that you recognise as being from one of the gates under Hellknight Hill. With the Scarlet Triad operation in the country of Ravounel now smashed, the team return victorious to Kintargo, where they are hailed as heroes by the authorities (the silver council), as well as the Bellflower Network and their allies at the Lady Docur school for girls. They are rewarded with (TBC): Vejonica gets a magical gourd that can turn into a small house Baba gets some Armbands of Athleticism Rab gets a Collar of Empathy for his warg animal companion Findir gets some rhino-hide armour Quan gets a set of dragon-hide armour that makes him immune to acid damage What will the team find when they venture through the Jewelgate?","title":"Tomorrow Must Burn"},{"location":"age-of-ashes/tomorrow-must-burn/#tomorrow-must-burn","text":"","title":"Tomorrow Must Burn"},{"location":"age-of-ashes/tomorrow-must-burn/#the-road-to-kintargo","text":"The team receive a mysterious letter from Heuberk Thropp inviting them to meet at the shop of the local wainwright.

Fighting a group of slavers and rescuing a prisoner, they find out that the attackers are slavers associated somehow with the Scarlet Triad , previously thought to be a respectable group of traders and merchants. VQFR first go and fight the slavers on the quay and on the boat, including a kalavakus demon. They free the prisoners, and head to the smokehouse where the leader of this attack is on the roof, directing. He knocks Rab down and kicks him unconscious several times while Quan and Findir deal with his pet flame drakes. Eventually they are all defeated and the team free the town leaders. They then make sure that no fires are being set in the boathouse and defeat a couple of krooths. With the town saved, they talk to a diplomat called Halleka Shadeborn from neighbouring Nidal , who wants to accompany them on their journey to the capital Kintargo . They decide to take the boat along the coast.","title":"The Road to Kintargo"},{"location":"age-of-ashes/tomorrow-must-burn/#shadows-on-the-silver-city","text":"Once they reach Kintargo, they are directed to dock at the pier of Sunset Imports . Rather than sneak in, they decide to break down the doors - there is a fight between the team and some bruisers and another kalavakus demon. Vejonica entirely fails to push piles of crates over. Once defeated, you free a halfling called Hundy Vosht who tells them that he was tortured and revealed the location of the members and allies of the Bellweather Network , a secret society dedicated to abolishing slavery. They also are disturbed by Sedranni Vashnarstill who tells the team that she is the owner of Sunset Imports, and that she allied with the Scarlet Triad without knowing who they really were. They had taken over her building and she is very grateful to the team for dealing with them. Heading to Kite Hill, the team meet Nolly Peltry , a halfling and leader of the Bellflower Network. She gives kites to the team for them to send coded messages and Findir does an exceptionally good job. However, at that moment a giant ice demon appears and attacks the locals, shouting \"For the Umbral Lord!\" and other praises of Nidal. The team defeat it (with Findir on its back again) and another halfling tells you that a wizard summoned the ice devil and he didn't look Nidalese. The team agrees to prevent rumours of a Nidalese attack. Rab tracks the wizard back towards town but loses the trail when they get to the stone road. Heading to the Long Roads Coffeehouse, you find it has already been attacked. The team overcomes a bunch of spirits, and then find and defeat a couple of shapeshifting rakshasas. They rescue a halfling who tells them that a group of workers had been taken to Tanessen Tower . Rab takes a big bag of coffee with him. At Lady Docur's school for girls, Findir makes a big mess of trying to charm Lady Docur. They find out that the school is actually secretly training girls in combat and is allied with the Bellflower Network. Because of this, the attackers were captured. The team agree that Lady Docur will discreetly dispose of the prisoners. Heading to the tower, Findir interrupts some poisoners who are making jokes on the podium, and a fight ensues. On the next level, a fight with two alchemical golems leads to a lot of exploding capsules. After defeating some more poisoners and thugs, the team finally face the wizard Barushak along with his summoned velstracts. The team easily defeat him by plenty of use of the \"Brexit Tackle\" and take his notes, written in Infernal. Rescuing Laria Longroad , she tells you that other slaves have already been taken to Summershade Quarry , and she promises that the team will have free coffee for life.","title":"Shadows on the Silver City"},{"location":"age-of-ashes/tomorrow-must-burn/#the-cornered-quarry","text":"VQFR drop by Lady Docur's school for girls again and manage to meet up with Findir's 3rd cousin 4 times removed - an elf monk called Baba Ganoush . Lady Docur wants him to accompany the team to help root out the slavers from the country. The team head south for a couple of days until they get to a small town, where the mayor / landowner admits that the quarry was abandoned partly because the workers found a strange cave that they believe to be haunted. Upon reaching the quarry, Quan and Rab check the guards, and find out that they have been dead for a while and have been posed to look like nothing is wrong. The team head into a lookout cave, where they surprise a bunch of thugs who were gambling when they should have been on lookout. The team kill these guards, but then another set of guards finds them. Baba is practicing his grappling quite a lot, and one of the guards ends up slowed, clumsy and confused. Once the toughest guard goes down, the others surrender. Leaving the remaining guards tied up, the team then progress through a tunnel in the side of the quarry until they reach a sleeping chamber with beds big enough for giants - and there are indeed four giants there. A fight ensues, and the giants fight fanatically to the death. Round the corner, they find a set of four large ghastly bears who look like they are guarding the entrance to another chamber. The team take them by surprise and quickly overwhelm the bears. Due to some comically low perception checks, the lich and his two giant assistants do not notice the fight and are also taken by surprise. The fight is quickly over as Baba, Vejonica and Quan overwhelm the lich and destroy his current body before he can react, and Findir and Rab manage to take out the two remaining giants. With this area now clear, Rab and Baba prise some emeralds out of some wall carvings while Vejonica heals everyone. The team continue round the quarry and find a chamber with some poisoners and an alchemical golem. Rab takes the opportunity to practice his bowmanship and lets off a few volleys. Baba and Quan both Brexit tackle a poisoner each, and Findir goes and attacks the golem, for which he gets an electricity bomb going off in his face. Rather miffed by this, he then Brexit tackles Baba for some reason. Vejonica has to intervene with a spell to make everyone think Baba is fatally wounded to calm things down. Once these enemies are defeated, the team go through to a luxuriously decorated room where a man lounges on a couch smoking a pipe and pondering a game board. He invites the team to take a look, and then surprises them by flipping the board over which releases a couple of greater shadows, while he transforms into a fiend in the shape of a gorilla. With things looking a bit perilous, Vejonica casts Celestial Accord, and the fiend critically fails his will save and hence becomes friendly to the team for 1 minute. Vejonica convinces him to join in with the fight against the greater shadows, which now becomes a cake-walk. Once defeated, Rab then convinces the fiend to take a drink of a refreshing tonic - which does quite a lot of damage to him - and everyone takes a shot at him to finish him off, a la Julius Caeser. Having a look around the room, the team \"salvage\" four bottles of fine wine, plus another bottle of less-than-fine wine, a bottle a sake, and some fancy rugs among other things. In the next chamber, they find the (currently empty) nest of Laslunn , a knoll and leader of the Scarlet Triad in Kintargo, who Vejonica recognises as being from Katapesh from the trappings around the nest. Laslunn is waiting by some mechanism when the team enter, and chuckles as she pulls a lever, which opens some sluices and causes gallons of water to flow across the chamber and down some tubes into the quarry. She taunts \"You've come all this way to rescue my slaves, but now they will all drown\" before firing a couple of arrows. Baba bravely fights the giant cyborg velstrac that is guarding the chamber, before getting wounded and starting to die. Rab grows his wings and starts throwing alchemist's fire from near the ceiling. Vejonica recognises it as a fiend, and casts some Divine Lances at it. Quan manages to flank it and do some sneak attacks. Findir rushes over to Laslunn and tries to distract her by doing the Macarena - failing at first, but then dazzling her for several rounds. After being revived by Vejonina (twice), Baba manages to knock the velstrac over and the team finish it off. Rab is desperately trying to close the sluices to slow the flow of water. At this point, Vejonica grabs some keys from Rab (that he found on the gorilla fiend) and slides down the tunnels like a flume to try to unlock the slaves and prevent them from drowning. Everyone else gangs up on Laslunn, until she decides to cut her losses, and she also escapes down the water slides - however Baba takes chase and finishes her off as she was about to escape. Rab takes some time to search the rest of the quarry and finds a large amount of liquor and the Eye of the Wise - which has markings that you recognise as being from one of the gates under Hellknight Hill. With the Scarlet Triad operation in the country of Ravounel now smashed, the team return victorious to Kintargo, where they are hailed as heroes by the authorities (the silver council), as well as the Bellflower Network and their allies at the Lady Docur school for girls. They are rewarded with (TBC): Vejonica gets a magical gourd that can turn into a small house Baba gets some Armbands of Athleticism Rab gets a Collar of Empathy for his warg animal companion Findir gets some rhino-hide armour Quan gets a set of dragon-hide armour that makes him immune to acid damage What will the team find when they venture through the Jewelgate?","title":"The Cornered Quarry"}]}
